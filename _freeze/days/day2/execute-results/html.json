Today explores how organizations source and cost the capital needed to fund investment opportunities. The day is structured into two complementary sessions:\n\n- **Morning Session: Sources of Finance** - Examines various financing options for both short-term and long-term needs ([Slides](../slides/day2-morning-slides.html))\n- **Afternoon Session: Cost of Capital** - Explores methods to calculate financing costs and determine optimal capital structure ([Slides](../slides/day2-afternoon-slides.html))\n\n## Morning Session Summary\n\nThe morning session explores the range of financing options available to organizations:\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Key Topics - Morning\n- The financing decision context and its relationship to investment decisions\n- Internal vs. external sources of finance\n- Short-term financing options (overdrafts, factoring, invoice discounting)\n- Medium-term financing options (term loans, hire purchase, leasing)\n- Long-term debt financing (corporate bonds)\n- Mezzanine finance and preference shares\n- Equity financing and rights issues\n- The finance gap and venture capital\n- Emerging and innovative financing sources\n:::\n\n### Learning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of the morning session, you will be able to:\n\n1. Identify and evaluate major internal and external sources of finance\n2. Assess the benefits and drawbacks of different financing methods\n3. Explain intermediation and disintermediation approaches to obtaining finance\n4. Apply knowledge to determine appropriate financing strategies for different types of organizations\n5. Evaluate how bank lending decisions are made\n\n### Featured Framework: Sources of Finance\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n    A[Sources of Finance] --> B[Internal Sources]\n    A --> C[External Sources]\n    B --> D[Retained Earnings]\n    B --> E[Working Capital Management]\n    C --> F[Short-term: < 1 year]\n    C --> G[Medium-term: 1-7 years]\n    C --> H[Long-term: > 7 years]\n    F --> I[Bank overdrafts]\n    F --> J[Factoring]\n    G --> K[Term loans]\n    G --> L[Leasing]\n    H --> M[Bonds]\n    H --> N[Equity]\n```\n\n\n\n## Afternoon Session Summary\n\nThe afternoon session focuses on calculating the cost of various sources of finance and determining optimal capital structure:\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Key Topics - Afternoon\n- Introduction to cost of capital concept\n- The cost of equity calculation methods:\n  - Dividend valuation model (no growth)\n  - Dividend growth model\n  - Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\n- The cost of debt calculation:\n  - Bank loans\n  - Redeemable bonds\n- Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)\n- Capital structure theory\n- Modigliani and Miller propositions\n:::\n\n### Learning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of the afternoon session, you will be able to:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of equity using multiple methods\n2. Determine the cost of debt for different debt instruments\n3. Compute a firm's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)\n4. Explain how the cost of capital impacts investment decisions\n5. Discuss theories of optimal capital structure\n\n### Featured Framework: WACC Calculation\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n    A[Cost of Capital Components] --> B[Cost of Equity]\n    A --> C[Cost of Debt]\n    B --> D[Dividend Models]\n    B --> E[CAPM]\n    D --> F[No-Growth Model]\n    D --> G[Dividend Growth Model]\n    C --> H[Untraded Debt]\n    C --> I[Traded Debt]\n    F --> J[WACC Calculation]\n    G --> J\n    E --> J\n    H --> J\n    I --> J\n```\n\n\n\n## Today's Integrated Learning\n\nThe day's sessions are designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how organizations fund investments:\n\n- Morning focus: Exploring **what** sources of finance are available to fund investments\n- Afternoon focus: Determining **how much** each source of finance costs\n\nThis integrated approach connects the investment decisions covered on Day 1 with the practical aspects of financing those investments.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Day 2 Essential Concepts\n\n1. **Sources of Finance**:\n   - Organizations should match the type of finance to the term of the investment (matching principle)\n   - A hierarchy of financing preferences typically exists: internal sources, then debt, then equity\n   - Cost, control implications, and risk profiles differ significantly across financing sources\n\n2. **Cost of Capital**:\n   - Cost of capital represents both the minimum required return on investments and the opportunity cost for investors\n   - The WACC provides a framework for investment appraisal by establishing a discount rate\n   - Capital structure decisions can impact overall cost of capital\n   - Theoretical frameworks suggest varying perspectives on optimal capital structure\n:::\n\n## Preparation for Next Session\n\nBuilding on the investment and financing discussions of Days 1-2, future sessions will explore:\n\n- Working capital management\n- Dividend policy considerations\n- Financial risk management\n- International financial management\n\nPlease review the practice exercises at the end of both today's sessions and prepare any questions for discussion.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n### Core Reading\n- Atrill, P.
