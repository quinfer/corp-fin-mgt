The purchase cost of each tonne is £15 and the cost of placing and handling an order is estimated to be £32. The cost of holding 1 tonne of sand for one year is estimated to be £4.\n\nCalculate the total annual cost of trading in this product.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe total annual cost consists of:\n1. The cost of purchases\n2. The cost of ordering\n3. The cost of holding inventory\n\nStep 1: Calculate EOQ\n$EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 10,000 \\times 32}{4}} = \\sqrt{160,000} = 400$ tonnes\n\nStep 2: Calculate number of orders per year\n$\\text{Number of orders} = \\frac{10,000}{400} = 25$ orders\n\nStep 3: Calculate total costs\n- Purchase cost = 10,000 × £15 = £150,000\n- Ordering cost = 25 × £32 = £800\n- Holding cost = (400/2) × £4 = £800\n- Total annual cost = £150,000 + £800 + £800 = £151,600\n:::\n\n## Just-in-Time (JIT) Inventory Management\n\nJIT aims to minimize inventory levels by having materials delivered just as they are needed:\n\n- Requires close relationships with suppliers\n- May necessitate re-engineering of production processes\n- Can reduce holding costs but may result in other hidden costs\n- Often implemented as part of Total Quality Management (TQM)\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nJIT can significantly reduce inventory costs but increases vulnerability to supply chain disruptions.\n:::\n\n## Managing Trade Receivables\n\nEffective management of trade receivables involves answering key questions:\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n### Key Questions\n\n1. Which customers should receive credit?\n2. How much credit should be offered?\n3. What length of credit should be offered?\n4. Should discounts be offered for prompt payment?\n5. What collection policies should be adopted?\n6. How can the risk of non-payment be reduced?\n\n### Credit Assessment\n\nThe \"Five Cs\" of credit:\n1. **Capital** - financial resources of the customer\n2. **Capacity** - ability to pay (cash flow)\n3. **Collateral** - assets that can secure the debt\n4. **Conditions** - economic environment\n5. **Character** - willingness to pay\n:::\n\n## Sources of Credit Information\n\nTo assess creditworthiness, businesses can use:\n\n- Trade references\n- Bank references\n- Published financial statements\n- Credit agencies\n- Register of County Court Judgments\n- Information from the customer\n- Other suppliers\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nUsing multiple sources provides a more complete picture of creditworthiness.\n:::\n\n## Credit Period Considerations\n\nThe length of credit offered may be influenced by:\n\n- Typical credit terms in the industry\n- Degree of competition\n- Bargaining power of customers\n- Risk of non-payment\n- Business capacity to offer credit\n- Marketing strategy\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nThe optimal credit period balances the marketing benefits of offering credit against the costs of financing receivables.\n:::\n\n## Collection Policies\n\nEffective collection procedures include:\n\n1. Developing customer relationships\n2. Publicizing credit terms clearly\n3. Issuing invoices promptly\n4. Monitoring outstanding debts\n5. Producing aging schedules of receivables\n6. Addressing queries quickly\n7. Following up on slow payers\n\n## Monitoring Receivables Performance\n\nThe key ratio for monitoring receivables:\n\n$$\\text{Average settlement period} = \\frac{\\text{Average trade receivables}}{\\text{Credit sales}} \\times 365$$\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nThis ratio indicates how long customers take to pay. A lower figure suggests more efficient credit management.\n:::\n\n## Managing Trade Payables\n\nTrade payables are an important source of finance. Effective management aims to:\n\n- Minimize administrative costs\n- Maximize the benefit from this low-cost form of finance\n- Maintain good supplier relationships\n- Take advantage of beneficial discounts\n\nThe key monitoring ratio is:\n\n$$\\text{Payables settlement period} = \\frac{\\text{Trade payables}}{\\text{Credit purchases}} \\times 365$$\n\n## Cash Management\n\n### Reasons for Holding Cash\n\nBusinesses hold cash for three primary reasons:\n\n1. To meet day-to-day commitments\n2. To deal with uncertain cash flows\n3. To exploit profitable opportunities\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nEffective cash management requires balancing liquidity needs against the opportunity cost of holding non-earning assets.\n:::\n\n## Factors Influencing Cash Holdings\n\nCash holdings are influenced by:\n\n- The nature of the business\n- The opportunity cost of holding cash\n- Inflation levels\n- Availability of near-liquid assets\n- Access to borrowing facilities\n- Cost of borrowing\n- Economic conditions\n- Relationships with suppliers\n\n## Cash Management Techniques\n\nThe main techniques for managing cash include:\n\n1. Controlling the cash balance (using control limits)\n2. Preparing projected cash flow statements\n3. Managing the operating cash cycle\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nCash management aims to maintain sufficient liquidity while minimizing idle cash balances.\n:::\n\n## The Operating Cash Cycle (OCC)\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| fig-width: 10\n%%| fig-cap: \"The operating cash cycle\"\nflowchart LR\n    A[Purchase\\nof goods\\non credit] --> B[Payment\\nfor goods]\n    B --> C[Sale\\nof goods\\non credit]\n    C --> D[Cash\\nreceived\\nfrom credit\\ncustomer]\n    \n    subgraph IP[\"Inventories turnover period\"]\n        A --> C\n    end\n    \n    subgraph OCC[\"Operating cash\\ncycle\"]\n        B --> D\n    end\n    \n    style A fill:#90CAF9,stroke:#90CAF9,stroke-width:1px\n    style B fill:#90CAF9,stroke:#90CAF9,stroke-width:1px\n    style C fill:#90CAF9,stroke:#90CAF9,stroke-width:1px\n    style D fill:#90CAF9,stroke:#90CAF9,stroke-width:1px\n    style OCC fill:#1976D2,stroke:#1976D2,color:white,stroke-width:2px\n```\n\n\n\nThe operating cash cycle represents the time between paying suppliers and receiving payment from customers.\n\n## Calculating the Operating Cash Cycle\n\nThe OCC is calculated as:\n\n$$\\text{OCC} = \\text{Inventory Turnover Period} + \\text{Receivables Period} - \\text{Payables Period}$$\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nA shorter OCC generally indicates more efficient working capital management, as cash is tied up for less time.\n:::\n\n## The Impact of OCC Length\n\n- The longer the OCC, the more expensive it is for the firm - cash is tied up longer\n- Cash supplied to the firm has a cost (from shareholders or debt holders)\n- Reducing the OCC helps reduce capital costs and improve profitability\n- As a general rule, a shorter OCC is preferable to a longer one\n\n## OCC by Company Size\n\nResearch shows OCC varies by company size:\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n### Small Companies (<€500m)\n\nTypically have longer OCCs:\n- 2013: 80 days\n- 2015: 85 days\n- 2017: 88 days\n\n### Medium Companies (€500m-€1bn)\n\nShow moderate OCCs:\n- 2013: 66 days\n- 2015: 69 days\n- 2017: 67 days\n\n### Large Companies (>€1bn)\n\nMaintain the shortest OCCs:\n- 2013: 41 days\n- 2015: 41 days\n- 2017: 42 days\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nLarger companies typically have more bargaining power with suppliers and customers, allowing them to maintain shorter OCCs.\n:::\n\n## Case Study: Calculating OCC\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n### Company Information\n\nOrton Ltd, a distributor of frozen foods, reports the following:\n- Inventory: Opening £142,000, Closing £166,000\n- Cost of Sales: £544,000\n- Trade Receivables: £264,000\n- Sales Revenue: £820,000\n- Trade Payables: £159,000\n- Purchases: £568,000\n\n### Calculation\n\n1. Inventory Turnover Period:\n   $\\frac{(142,000 + 166,000)/2}{544,000} \\times 365 = 103$ days\n\n2. Receivables Settlement Period:\n   $\\frac{264,000}{820,000} \\times 365 = 118$ days\n\n3. Payables Settlement Period:\n   $\\frac{159,000}{568,000} \\times 365 = 102$ days\n\n4. Operating Cash Cycle:\n   $103 + 118 - 102 = 119$ days\n\n### Improvement Strategies\n\nThe company could reduce its OCC by:\n\n1. **Reducing Inventory Holding Period**:\n   - Implement better inventory forecasting\n   - Use JIT where possible\n   - Review product range to eliminate slow-moving items\n\n2. **Reducing Receivables Period**:\n   - Tighten credit control procedures\n   - Offer discounts for prompt payment\n   - Implement more efficient invoicing systems\n\n3. **Extending Payables Period** (carefully):\n   - Negotiate longer payment terms with suppliers\n   - Ensure payment terms are fully utilized\n   - Maintain good supplier relationships\n:::\n\n## Summary\n\n- Working capital management involves balancing current assets and liabilities\n- The working capital cycle shows how resources flow through a business\n- Effective inventory management requires balancing holding and ordering costs\n- Trade receivables management involves credit assessment and collection policies\n- Cash management aims to maintain sufficient liquidity while minimizing idle funds\n- The operating cash cycle measures efficiency in working capital management\n- Shorter OCCs generally indicate more efficient working capital management\n\n## Practice Questions\n\n1. A company has average inventory of £500,000, annual cost of sales of £4 million, average trade receivables of £800,000, annual credit sales of £6 million, and average trade payables of £600,000 with annual credit purchases of £3.5 million. Calculate:\n   a) The inventory turnover period\n   b) The receivables collection period\n   c) The payables payment period\n   d) The operating cash cycle\n\n2. Using the EOQ model, calculate the optimal order quantity for a product with annual demand of 8,000 units, ordering cost of £50 per order, and holding cost of £5 per unit per year.\n\n3. Critically evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of implementing a Just-in-Time inventory system for a manufacturing business.\n\n4. Discuss how a company might reduce its operating cash cycle and evaluate the potential benefits and risks of such actions.\n\n5. Analyze how the \"Five Cs\" of credit can be used to assess customer creditworthiness, giving examples of information sources for each criterion.\n",
