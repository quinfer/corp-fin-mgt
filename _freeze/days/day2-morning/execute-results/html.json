Understand the financing decision context and its relationship to investment decisions\n2. Identify and evaluate the major internal and external sources of finance\n3. Assess the benefits and drawbacks of different financing methods\n4. Explain the different approaches to obtaining finance through intermediation and disintermediation\n5. Apply knowledge to determine appropriate financing strategies for organisations of different sizes\n:::\n\n## The Financing Decision\n\nAfter making capital investment decisions using the appraisal techniques covered yesterday, the finance manager must turn attention to the financing decision – finding suitable sources to fund those investments.\n\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n### The Financing Context\n\nThe financing decision follows logically from the investment decision and involves determining:\n\n- What sources of finance are available (internal vs external)\n- What term of borrowing the funding is available for\n- How much each potential source of finance costs (cost of capital)\n\n### Financing Decision Framework\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n    A[Investment Decision Made] --> B[Identify Financing Needs]\n    B --> C[Review Internal Sources]\n    B --> D[Review External Sources]\n    C --> E[Evaluate Cost and Availability]\n    D --> E\n    E --> F[Structure Financing Package]\n    F --> G[Implement Financing Strategy]\n    G --> H[Monitor and Review]\n```\n\n\n\n### Real-World Context\n\nFinancing decisions are critical to:\n\n- Enterprise sustainability and growth\n- Risk management\n- Shareholder value creation\n- Corporate governance\n- Financial flexibility\n:::\n\n## Internal vs External Sources of Finance\n\nOrganisations can source funding either internally from operations or externally from capital markets and financial institutions.\n\n:::{.grid}\n::: {.g-col-6}\n**Internal Finance Sources:**\n\nInternal finance comes from the operational activities of the business itself and includes:\n\n- Retained earnings (profit ploughback)\n- Working capital management:\n  - Tighter credit control\n  - Reduced inventory levels\n  - Delayed payment to suppliers\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-6}\n**External Finance Sources:**\n\nExternal finance is raised from outside the business through:\n\n- Debt (borrowings)\n- Equity (shares)\n- Hybrid instruments (convertibles, preference shares)\n- Leasing and similar arrangements\n- Factoring and invoice discounting\n:::\n:::\n\n## The Major Internal Sources of Finance\n\nInternal financing is often preferred as it avoids the costs, formalities, and external scrutiny associated with raising external finance.\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart LR\n    A[Internal Finance Sources] --> B[Short-term Sources]\n    A --> C[Long-term Sources]\n    B --> D[Tighter credit control]\n    B --> E[Reduced inventory levels]\n    B --> F[Delayed payments to creditors]\n    C --> G[Retained profits]\n```\n\n\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n## Working Capital Management\nEffective working capital management can release significant funds from day-to-day operations. However, there are limits to such strategies:\n\n- Excessive credit control may alienate customers\n- Minimal inventory may lead to stockouts and lost sales\n- Delayed supplier payments can damage critical relationships\n:::\n\n## The Major External Sources of Finance\n\nExternal sources represent a wide spectrum of options ranging from short-term facilities to long-term capital.\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n    A[External Finance Sources] --> B[Short-term: < 1 year]\n    A --> C[Medium-term: 1-7 years]\n    A --> D[Long-term: > 7 years]\n    B --> E[Bank overdrafts]\n    B --> F[Invoice discounting]\n    B --> G[Debt factoring]\n    B --> H[Bills of exchange]\n    C --> I[Term loans]\n    C --> J[Hire purchase]\n    C --> K[Leasing]\n    D --> L[Corporate bonds]\n    D --> M[Preference shares]\n    D --> N[Ordinary shares]\n    D --> O[Securitisation]\n```\n\n\n\n## Approaches to Obtaining Finance\n\nThere are two primary approaches through which organisations can access external finance.\n\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n### Intermediation\n\n**Intermediation** is where finance is arranged through financial institutions such as commercial banks.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Institution acts as intermediary between savers and borrowers\n- Involves screening and monitoring by the institution\n- Offers professional expertise and risk assessment\n- Typically used by businesses of all sizes\n- Often involves developing ongoing banking relationships\n\n**Examples:**\n- Bank loans and overdrafts\n- Factoring and invoice discounting\n- Leasing arrangements through finance companies\n\n### Disintermediation\n\n**Disintermediation** is where the financial intermediary's role is bypassed, with companies going directly to the money markets or stock exchanges to obtain finance.\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Direct access to capital markets\n- Restricted to large, reputable companies\n- Used for substantial funding requirements\n- Often more cost-effective for large sums\n- Requires substantial disclosure and market reputation\n\n**Examples:**\n- Corporate bond issues\n- Public share offerings\n- Commercial paper issuance\n:::\n\n## Bank Finance: The Lending Decision\n\nBanks are a primary source of external finance for many businesses. Understanding their lending criteria is essential for successful financing applications.\n\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n### The Lending Assessment\n\nBanks typically consider two core aspects when making lending decisions:\n\n1. **Going concern assessment**: Determining whether the borrowing company can afford to make repayments from its ongoing operations.\n\n2. **Liquidation assessment**: Evaluating the recoverability of capital in the event the company goes into liquidation.\n\n### The Seven C's of Lending\n\nA traditional framework used by banks to evaluate potential borrowers includes:\n\n1. Character\n2. Capacity\n3. Capital\n4. Conditions\n5. Customer relations\n6. Competition\n7.

Sell an existing asset (typically property)\n2. Immediately lease it back from the buyer\n3. Continue using the asset while releasing equity capital\n4. Generate immediate cash flow improvement\n5. Potentially achieve favorable accounting treatment\n\nThis approach can be structured either with:\n- A subsidiary company (lower risk)\n- An external company (potentially higher risk)\n:::\n\n## Long-Term Finance: Debt\n\nDebt represents a significant source of long-term finance for many businesses.\n\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n### Debt Finance Benefits\n\nLong-term debt offers several advantages:\n\n- Cheaper and quicker to obtain than equity\n- Interest is tax-deductible\n- No dilution of ownership or control\n- Can reduce overall WACC (weighted average cost of capital)\n- Can be structured with tailored repayment schedules\n- Lower risk for investors (but less potential return)\n\n### Debt Finance Drawbacks\n\nHowever, debt also poses challenges:\n\n- Increases financial risk for the company\n- Requires regular interest payments regardless of profitability\n- Often secured against company assets\n- May include restrictive covenants\n- Can limit managerial decision-making flexibility\n- May restrict future borrowing capacity\n\n### Restrictive Covenants\n\nLenders frequently impose covenants to protect their interests:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Covenant Type                 |Description

|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Corporate Bonds\n\nCorporate bonds represent a formalized debt security that can be traded in financial markets:\n\n- Tradable loans with defined nominal (par) value\n- Feature specified coupon rates for interest payments\n- May be issued with redeemable or irredeemable terms\n- Typically have 7-30 year maturities (if redeemable)\n- Can be issued publicly or through private placement\n- May be secured or unsecured\n\n**Key bond characteristics:**\n- Nominal value (typically £/€100)\n- Coupon rate (interest payment)\n- Redemption value (usually par value)\n- Redemption date (for redeemable bonds)\n:::\n\n## Long-Term Finance: Mezzanine Finance and Preference Shares\n\nBetween traditional debt and equity lies a range of hybrid financing instruments.\n\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n### Mezzanine Finance Overview\n\nMezzanine finance represents higher-risk, higher-return capital that fills the gap between senior debt and equity:\n\n- Long-term, subordinated financing\n- Higher interest rates reflecting increased risk\n- Often includes equity-like features (warrants, conversion rights)\n- Typically unsecured\n- Used as a last resort before equity dilution\n- Main types include junk bonds, convertible bonds, and preference shares\n\n### Junk Bonds\n\nJunk bonds (high-yield bonds) are debt securities with lower credit ratings:\n\n- Used by companies with weaker financial positions\n- Carry higher interest rates to compensate for increased risk\n- Attract risk-taking investors seeking higher returns\n- Subject to higher default probability\n- May include more stringent covenants\n\n### Convertible Bonds\n\nConvertible bonds combine debt features with an option to convert to equity:\n\n- Fixed return securities with conversion option\n- Allow holders to convert to shares at predetermined dates\n- Often issued when share prices appear undervalued\n- Represent a deferred equity sale\n- Generally offer lower interest rates than straight debt\n- Reduce immediate dilution while providing potential equity upside\n- Potentially eliminate cash repayment requirement if converted\n\n### Preference Shares\n\nPreference shares combine features of both debt and equity:\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n- Part of share capital but typically not considered pure equity\n- May be issued at premium above nominal value\n- Usually carry fixed dividends\n- Generally confer no voting rights\n- May be redeemable and/or convertible\n- Higher in capital structure than ordinary shares but below bonds\n- Dividends are not tax-deductible\n\n**Types of preference shares:**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Type                             |Description

   |\n|Non-cumulative preference shares |Unpaid dividends are lost if not declared                 |\n|Participating preference shares  |Holders can participate in surplus profits                |\n|Convertible preference shares    |Convertible to ordinary shares under specified conditions |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Advantages of preference shares:**\n- Dividends can be waived in difficult periods\n- Preserve ownership structure\n- Can improve gearing after conversion (if convertible)\n- Easier to obtain than bonds for highly geared companies\n\n**Disadvantages of preference shares:**\n- More expensive than debt\n- Dividends not tax-deductible\n- May require redemption or conversion in future\n:::\n\n## Long-Term Finance: Equity\n\nOrdinary shares (common stock) represent the fundamental risk capital of the business.\n\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n### Equity Fundamentals\n\nEquity represents ownership interest in a business:\n\n- Shareholders own a portion of the company\n- Nominal value assigned but not related to market value\n- May be traded (public companies) or not (private companies)\n- Usually entitles holders to dividends from profits\n- Provides pre-emptive rights in future share issues\n- Most risky form of financing from investor perspective\n- Least risky from company perspective\n\n### Equity Advantages\n\nFrom the company's perspective, equity offers several benefits:\n\n- Lowest financial risk of all external finance\n- No obligation to pay dividends\n- No requirement to redeem capital\n- No fixed repayment schedule\n- Provides permanent capital base\n- Increases capacity to raise additional debt\n\n### Equity Disadvantages\n\nHowever, equity also has significant drawbacks:\n\n- Expensive to issue (5-10% of funds raised)\n- Minimum fixed costs limit accessibility to larger companies\n- Substantial administrative and regulatory requirements\n- Dividends not tax-deductible\n- Dilution of control\n- Highest required return of all financing sources\n\n### Methods of Issuing Equity\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Method                        |Description

specific institutional investors               |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Rights Issues\n\nFor existing listed companies, rights issues provide an efficient mechanism to raise additional equity:\n\n- Offered to existing shareholders in proportion to holdings\n- Typically priced at 15-20% discount to market value\n- Lower transaction costs than public offerings\n- Administratively simpler with existing shareholder base\n- Existing shareholders can either subscribe or sell rights\n- Market price adjusts to account for discount\n:::\n\n## The Finance Gap and Venture Capital\n\nMany growing businesses face a \"finance gap\" where conventional financing sources are insufficient.\n\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n### The Finance Gap\n\nThe finance gap (or equity gap) typically emerges when:\n\n- New companies require substantial scale of financing\n- Existing small companies experience rapid growth\n- Bank lending reaches prudential limits\n- Retained earnings are insufficient\n- Private equity holders lack capacity for further investment\n- Company is too small for public market access\n\n### Venture Capital\n\nVenture capital provides specialized equity financing to bridge this gap:\n\n- Focuses on high-risk, high-return, high-growth potential companies\n- Typically targets 30%+ annual returns\n- Portfolio approach with mixed outcomes expected\n- Generally involves deals exceeding £250,000\n- Requires equity stake and element of control\n- Prefers companies with established track records\n- Necessitates clear exit strategy (IPO or trade sale)\n\n**Benefits to recipient companies:**\n- Access to capital at crucial growth stage\n- Business expertise and mentoring\n- Industry contacts and networks\n- Strategic guidance\n- Potential follow-on financing\n\n**Drawbacks for recipient companies:**\n- Dilution of ownership\n- Loss of some decision-making autonomy\n- Increased reporting and accountability\n- Pressure to achieve growth targets\n- Exit timeline constraints\n\n### Government Initiatives\n\nVarious government schemes aim to address the finance gap:\n\n**Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS):**\n- Tax relief (30%) for investors in qualifying companies\n- Investment limit of £1 million per annum\n- Companies can raise up to £5 million annually\n- Aimed at unlisted companies\n\n**Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs):**\n- Similar tax benefits to EIS\n- Minimum five-year investment period\n- Professionally managed funds\n- Diversified portfolio approach\n:::\n\n## New Sources of Finance\n\nThe financing landscape continues to evolve with innovative funding mechanisms.\n\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n### Crowdfunding\n\nCrowdfunding has emerged as a significant alternative funding source:\n\n- Peer-to-peer lending platforms\n- Equity-based crowdfunding\n- Reward-based crowdfunding\n- Donation-based funding\n- Real estate crowdfunding\n\nThese platforms connect entrepreneurs directly with numerous small investors, bypassing traditional financial intermediaries.\n\n### Asset-Based Finance\n\nAsset-based lending focuses on the value of specific assets:\n\n- Supply chain finance\n- Marketplace lending\n- Invoice trading platforms\n- Peer-to-peer secured lending\n- Asset refinancing\n\n### Fintech Innovations\n\nFinancial technology is transforming the financing landscape:\n\n- Blockchain-based financing\n- Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)\n- Security Token Offerings (STOs)\n- Artificial intelligence in lending decisions\n- Open banking initiatives\n:::\n\n## Key Source of Finance Principles\n\nSeveral fundamental principles should guide financing decisions in practice.\n\n:::{.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\n- The type of finance should match the term of the investment (matching principle)\n- Management typically follows a \"pecking order\": internal sources first, then debt, then equity\n- Market-sourced finance is primarily viable for larger companies due to transaction costs\n- SMEs should prioritize bank financing, medium-term instruments, and venture capital\n- Cost of each source correlates with the risk borne by investors\n- Venture capital targets high-risk, high-return companies in the finance gap\n- Comprehensive business plans with robust financial projections are essential for external financing\n- Innovative financing sources continue to expand options, particularly for early-stage companies\n:::\n\n## For This Afternoon {.unnumbered}\n\nThis afternoon, we will build on this morning's exploration of financing sources to focus on:\n- Cost of capital calculations\n- Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)\n- Capital structure decisions\n- Optimal gearing levels\n- Dividend policy considerations\n\nPlease review the case studies in the module materials to prepare for our
