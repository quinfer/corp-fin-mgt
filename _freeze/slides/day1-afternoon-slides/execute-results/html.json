Explain the nature and importance of investment decision-making\n2. Identify and evaluate the five main investment appraisal methods found in practice\n3. Use these methods to reach decisions on investment opportunities\n4. Explain the key stages in the investment decision-making process\n5. Apply techniques to handle risk in investment decisions\n:::\n\n## The Nature of Investment Decisions\n\nInvestment decisions represent long-term commitments of substantial resources with uncertain returns. They are among the most consequential decisions finance managers must make.\n\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n### Key Characteristics\n\nCapital investment decisions typically involve:\n\n- Large amounts of resources\n- Relatively long timescales\n- Difficulty or expense in reversing the investment once undertaken\n- Strategic implications for the organisation's future direction\n- Complex risk considerations\n\n### Investment Decision Framework\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n    A[Identify investment opportunity] --> B[Gather relevant information]\n    B --> C[Evaluate using appraisal techniques]\n    C --> D[Consider risk factors]\n    D --> E[Make investment decision]\n    E --> F[Implement and monitor]\n    F --> G[Post-implementation review]\n```\n\n\n\n### Real-World Example\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry provides a classic example of the capital investment decision challenge:\n\n- Initial R&D investment: £500m+\n- Development timeline: 10-15 years\n- Success rate: Only 1 in 10 compounds receives regulatory approval\n- Strategic importance: Defines company product pipeline for decades\n- High uncertainty: Market conditions may change substantially before launch\n:::\n\n## Cash Flows vs. Accounting Profits\n\nA fundamental principle in capital investment appraisal is the focus on cash flows rather than accounting profits.\n\n:::{.grid}\n::: {.g-col-6}\n**Key Equation:**\n$$\\text{Cash Flow} = \\text{Profit} + \\text{Depreciation} + \\text{Other non-cash adjustments}$$\n\n**Why Focus on Cash Flows?**\n\n- Cash is objective and measurable\n- Profits are subject to accounting policies\n- Cash flow timing directly impacts value\n- Investment decisions affect cash balances\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-6}\n**Relevant Cash Flows Are:**\n\n- Incremental (arising directly from the project)\n- Future (not past/sunk costs)\n- After-tax\n\n**Irrelevant Items Include:**\n\n- Sunk costs\n- Non-incremental overhead allocations\n- Interest payments (captured in discount rate)\n- Accounting conventions\n:::\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n## Common Error\nIncluding already committed (sunk) costs in investment appraisal calculations.

Inflation\n- Risk\n\nDCF methods explicitly account for this through discounting.\n\n### Selection in Practice\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](day1-afternoon-slides_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n## Payback Period (PP)\n\nThe Payback Period is the time required to recover the initial investment from project cash flows.\n\n## Definition & Calculation\n\n$$\\text{Payback Period} = \\text{Time until} \\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\text{Cash Flow}_t = 0$$\n\nWhere:\n- t = time period (typically years)\n- n = payback period\n\n**Decision Rule:**\n- Accept projects with PP < maximum acceptable period\n- Between competing projects, prefer shorter payback\n\n## Example\n\nA project costs £500,000 with the following expected cash flows:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| Year| Cash Flow (£)| Cumulative Cash Flow

(170,000 ÷ 200,000) = 2.85 years\n\n## Advantages & Limitations\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Simple to calculate and understand\n- Focuses on liquidity and capital recovery\n- Provides a crude measure of risk\n- Popular in practice\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Ignores cash flows after the payback period\n- Fails to consider time value of money\n- Ignores the scale of investment\n- Payback threshold typically arbitrary\n- Not linked to shareholder wealth maximization\n:::\n\n## Discounted Payback Period (DPP)\n\nThe Discounted Payback Period addresses a key limitation of the standard payback by considering the time value of money.\n\n## Definition & Calculation\n\n$$\\text{Discounted Payback Period} = \\text{Time until} \\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow}_t}{(1+r)^t} = 0$$\n\nWhere:\n- t = time period (typically years)\n- r = discount rate\n- n = discounted payback period\n\n**Decision Rule:**\n- Accept projects with DPP < maximum acceptable period\n- Between competing projects, prefer shorter discounted payback\n\n## Example\n\nUsing the same project with a 10% discount rate:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| Year| Cash Flow (£)| Discount Factor|

Maintains simplicity of interpretation\n- More realistic measure of capital recovery time\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Still ignores cash flows after the payback period\n- Arbitrary threshold for acceptable period\n- Not directly linked to shareholder wealth maximization\n:::\n\n## Net Present Value (NPV)\n\nThe Net Present Value method is the most theoretically sound approach to investment appraisal, directly linking to shareholder wealth maximization.\n\n\n## Definition & Calculation\n\n$$\\text{NPV} = \\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow}_t}{(1+r)^t}$$\n\nWhere:\n- t = time period (typically years)\n- r = discount rate (cost of capital)\n- n = project lifetime\n\n**Decision Rule:**\n- Accept projects with NPV > 0\n- Reject projects with NPV < 0\n- Between competing projects, prefer higher NPV\n\n## Discount Rate Components\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart LR\n    A[Risk-free rate] --> D[Required return]\n    B[Inflation premium] --> D\n    C[Risk premium] --> D\n    D --> E[Discount rate for NPV]\n```\n\n\n\nThe discount rate used in NPV calculations reflects:\n- Time value of money (risk-free rate)\n- Inflation expectations\n- Project-specific risk factors\n\n## Example\n\nUsing the same project with a 10% discount rate:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| Year| Cash Flow (£)| Discount Factor| Discounted CF

Directly linked to shareholder wealth maximization\n- Allows for risk adjustment via discount rate\n- Additive across projects\n\n**Limitations:**\n- More complex to calculate and explain\n- Highly sensitive to discount rate selection\n- Assumes reinvestment at the discount rate\n- Provides absolute rather than relative measure\n:::\n\n## Internal Rate of Return (IRR)\n\nThe Internal Rate of Return is the discount rate at which a project's NPV equals zero, representing the project's \"yield.\"\n\n\n## Definition & Calculation\n\nIRR is the value of r that satisfies:\n\n$$\\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow}_t}{(1+r)^t} = 0$$\n\nTypically solved through iteration or financial calculators.\n\n**Decision Rule:**\n- Accept projects with IRR > cost of capital\n- Reject projects with IRR < cost of capital\n- Between competing projects, prefer higher IRR\n\n## Example\n\nUsing the same project cash flows:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| Year| Cash Flow (£)|\n|----:|-------------:|\n|    0|       -500000|\n|    1|        150000|\n|    2|        180000|\n|    3|        200000|\n|    4|        120000|\n|    5|        100000|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIRR = 16.46%\n\nSince IRR (16.46%) > Cost of capital (10%), the project is acceptable.\n\n## NPV-IRR Relationship\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n:::

return format\n- Accounts for time value of money\n- Considers all cash flows\n- Popular with practitioners\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Multiple IRRs possible with non-conventional cash flows\n- Scale of investment not considered\n- Reinvestment assumption may be unrealistic\n- Ranking conflicts with NPV possible\n- Not directly linked to shareholder wealth maximization\n:::\n\n## Accounting Rate of Return (ARR)\n\nThe Accounting Rate of Return focuses on accounting profit rather than cash flows.\n\n\n## Definition & Calculation\n\n$$\\text{ARR} = \\frac{\\text{Average annual profit}}{\\text{Average investment}} \\times 100\\%$$\n\nWhere:\n- Average annual profit = Total project profits ÷ Project life\n- Average investment = (Initial investment + Residual value) ÷ 2\n\n**Decision Rule:**\n- Accept projects with ARR > minimum required return\n- Reject projects with ARR < minimum required return\n- Between competing projects, prefer higher ARR\n\n## Example\n\nA

years)**: If the maximum acceptable payback is 3 years, the project is acceptable.\n\n2. **Discounted Payback (3.74 years)**: If the maximum acceptable discounted payback is 4 years, the project is acceptable.\n\n3. **NPV (£22,977)**: The positive NPV indicates the project adds value to the business and should be accepted.\n\n4. **IRR (23.92%)**: If the cost of capital is 10%, the project's IRR substantially exceeds this threshold and should be accepted.\n\n5. **ARR (16.4%)**: If the minimum required ARR is 15%, the project is acceptable.\n\n**Recommendation**: The investment in the plumbing business appears financially viable across all appraisal methods. The positive NPV and high IRR are particularly encouraging indicators of value creation.\n\n## Risk in Investment Decisions\n\nInvestment decisions inherently involve risk and uncertainty. Several methods exist to incorporate risk assessment into the appraisal process.\n\n## Risk Assessment Approaches\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n    A[Risk Assessment Methods] --> B[Sensitivity Analysis]\n    A --> C[Scenario Analysis]\n    A --> D[Risk-Adjusted Discount Rate]\n    A --> E[Probability-Based Methods]\n    E --> F[Expected NPV]\n    E --> G[Monte Carlo Simulation]\n    A --> H[Real Options Analysis]\n```\n\n\n\n## Sensitivity Analysis\n\nSensitivity analysis examines how changes in key variables affect project outcomes.\n\n**Process:**\n1. Identify key variables (e.g., sales volume, price, costs)\n2. Calculate impact of percentage changes in each variable\n3. Identify switching points where NPV becomes zero\n4. Focus management attention on most sensitive variables\n\n**Example**: For our plumbing business, how much would each variable need to change to make NPV zero?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Variable           |Base Value   |Change for Zero NPV     |Interpretation       |\n|:------------------|:------------|:-----------------------|:--------------------|\n|Initial investment |£45,000      |+51.1%                  |Low sensitivity      |\n|Annual cash flows  |As projected |-24.0%                  |Moderate sensitivity |\n|Exit value         |£41,000      |-56.0%                  |Low sensitivity      |\n|Discount rate      |10%          |+13.9 percentage points |Low sensitivity      |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Scenario Analysis\n\nScenario analysis evaluates the project under different sets of assumptions.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Scenario    |Annual Growth |Exit Multiple |NPV     |IRR   |\n|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|:-------|:-----|\n|Pessimistic |5%            |1.0x          |£3,250  |12.1% |\n|Most likely |10%           |1.5x          |£22,977 |23.9% |\n|Optimistic  |15%           |2.0x          |£48,350 |36.2% |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Expected NPV\n\nExpected NPV incorporates probability estimates for different outcomes.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Scenario       |Probability |NPV     |Weighted NPV |\n|:--------------|:-----------|:-------|:------------|\n|Pessimistic    |0.25        |£3,250  |£813         |\n|Most likely    |0.50        |£22,977 |£11,489      |\n|Optimistic     |0.25        |£48,350 |£12,088      |\n|Expected value |1.00        |        |£24,390      |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Risk Attitudes\n\nDifferent investors have different risk preferences:\n\n- **Risk-averse** investors: Require compensation for bearing risk\n- **Risk-neutral** investors: Focus solely on expected values\n- **Risk-seeking** investors: Willing to accept lower expected returns for chance of higher gains\n\nMost corporate decision-makers are risk-averse, which is reflected in:\n- Use of hurdle rates above the cost of capital\n- Preference for shorter payback periods\n- Conservative cash flow projections\n:::\n\n## Investment Decision Process in Practice\n\nThe investment appraisal techniques are part of a broader investment decision-making process:\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n    A[1.

A project requires an initial investment of £200,000 and is expected to generate annual cash flows of £50,000 for 5 years. Calculate the project's payback period, NPV (using a 12% discount rate), and IRR.\n\n2. Company A is considering two mutually exclusive projects with the following cash flows:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| Year| Project X (£)| Project Y (£)|\n|----:|-------------:|-------------:|\n|    0|       -300000|       -300000|\n|    1|        100000|        250000|\n|    2|        150000|        100000|\n|    3|        150000|         50000|\n|    4|         50000|         25000|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nUsing a discount rate of 10%, calculate:\n   - The NPV of each project\n   - The IRR of each project\n   - The payback period of each project\n   - Which project should be selected and why?\n\n3. How would your recommendation for question 2 change if:\n   - The company's cost of capital increased to 15%?\n   - The company faced capital rationing and could only invest £200,000?\n   - Project Y's Year 1 cash flow was uncertain and could vary by ±20%?\n\n## Real Options in Capital Investment Decisions\n\nReal options analysis recognises that investment decisions often contain embedded options that can significantly impact project value.\n\n\n## Real Options Framework\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n    A[Real Options in Investment] --> B[Option to Defer]\n    A --> C[Option to Expand]\n    A --> D[Option to Abandon]\n    A --> E[Option to Contract]\n    A --> F[Option to Switch]\n```\n\n\n\nReal options create value through managerial flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\n## Common Real Option Types\n\n| Option Type | Description | Value Driver |\n|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Defer | Ability to postpone investment | Reduces uncertainty before committing |\n| Expand | Opportunity to increase scale | Captures upside potential |\n| Abandon | Ability to exit unprofitable projects | Limits downside risk |\n| Contract | Option to reduce project scale | Mitigates losses in adverse conditions |\n| Switch | Flexibility to change inputs/outputs | Adapts to changing market conditions |\n\n## Valuation Approaches\n\nReal options can be valued using:\n\n1. **Black-Scholes Model** - For simple options with clear parameters\n2. **Binomial Lattice** - For more complex, multi-stage options\n3. **Monte Carlo Simulation** - For highly uncertain, complex situations\n\n## Practical Example\n\nA mining company considering a new site can view the investment as a series of options:\n\n- Initial exploration (low cost, creates option to develop)\n- Development phase (higher investment, creates option to extract)\n- Extraction operations (option to expand/contract based on commodity prices)\n- Site closure (abandonment option if prices fall below extraction costs)\n:::\n\n## Capital Rationing Decision Tree\n\nWhen facing capital constraints, a structured approach helps maximise value creation.\n\n\n## Decision Framework\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n    A[Capital Rationing Situation] --> B{Soft or Hard?}\n    B -->|Soft| C[Internal Policy Constraint]\n    B -->|Hard| D[External Market Constraint]\n    C --> E[Challenge Constraint]\n    C --> F[Work Within Constraint]\n    D --> G[Optimise Within Constraint]\n    E --> H[NPV Ranking]\n    F --> I[PI Ranking]\n    G --> I\n    I --> J[Mathematical Programming]\n```\n\n\n\n## Profitability Index Calculation\n\n$$\\text{PI} = \\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{\\text{Cash Flow}_t}{(1+r)^t}}{\\text{Initial Investment}}$$\n\n**Interpretation:**\n- PI > 1.0: Project creates value\n- PI = 1.0: Project breaks even\n- PI < 1.0: Project destroys value\n\n## Mathematical Programming Approach\n\nFor complex situations with multiple constraints, linear programming can be used:\n\n**Objective function:**\n$$\\text{Maximise } \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\text{NPV}_j \\times X_j$$\n\n**Subject to constraints:**\n$$\\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\text{Investment}_j \\times X_j \\leq \\text{Capital Budget}$$\n$$X_j \\in \\{0,1\\} \\text{ or } 0 \\leq X_j \\leq 1 \\text{ (depending on divisibility)}$$\n\nWhere:\n- $X_j$ represents the proportion of project $j$ undertaken\n- $m$ is the number of available projects\n\n\n## Incorporating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Factors\n\nModern investment appraisal increasingly considers ESG impacts alongside financial returns.\n\n## ESG Framework\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n    A[ESG-Integrated Investment Appraisal] --> B[Environmental Factors]\n    A --> C[Social Factors]\n    A --> D[Governance Factors]\n    B --> E[Carbon Pricing]\n    B --> F[Resource Efficiency]\n    C --> G[Community Impact]\n    C --> H[Human Capital]\n    D --> I[Risk Management]\n    D --> J[Stakeholder Alignment]\n```\n\n\n\n## Quantification Methods\n\n| ESG Factor | Quantification Approach | Financial Integration |\n|------------|-------------------------|----------------------|\n| Carbon emissions | Shadow carbon price | Additional cost per tonne CO₂e |\n| Water usage | True cost of water | Adjusted operating expenses |\n| Community benefits | Social return on investment (SROI) | External benefit valuation |\n| Human capital | Productivity differentials | Adjusted revenue/cost projections |\n| Governance quality | Risk premium adjustment | Modified discount rate |\n\n## Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis\n\nWhen ESG factors are difficult to monetise, a weighted scoring approach can be used:\n\n$$\\text{Project Score} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \\times \\text{Factor Score}_i$$\n\nWhere:\n- $w_i$ represents the weight assigned to factor $i$\n- $\\text{Factor Score}_i$ is the performance score for factor $i$\n- $n$ is the number of decision factors (financial and non-financial)\n\n## Case Example: Renewable Energy
