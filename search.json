What is the dividend yield?\nSolution:\n\n\nCode\n# Given information\nEPS &lt;- 0.25  # Earnings per share in £\nDPR &lt;- 0.60  # Dividend payout ratio (60%)\nPE &lt;- 20     # Price earnings ratio\n\n# Calculate dividend per share\nDPS &lt;- EPS * DPR\nDPS\n\n\n[1] 0.15\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate market value per share\nMarket_Value &lt;- EPS * PE\nMarket_Value\n\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate dividend yield\nDividend_Yield &lt;- (DPS / Market_Value) * 100\nDividend_Yield\n\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\n\nA business has a ROCE of 20% and a sales revenue to long-term capital employed ratio of 5 times. It has an operating profit of £2m. What is the sales revenue of the business?\nSolution: ROCE = Operating profit / Capital employed = 20% Capital employed = Operating profit / ROCE = £2m / 0.20 = £10m\nSales revenue / Capital employed = 5 Therefore, Sales revenue = 5 × £10m = £50m\n\n\nA business has the following ratios: - Gross profit margin: 25% - Operating expenses to sales: 10% - Interest cover: 3 times - Sales for the period: £20m\nWhat is the profit before tax?\nSolution: Gross profit = 25% × £20m = £5m Operating expenses = 10% × £20m = £2m Operating profit = £5m - £2m = £3m Interest cover = Operating profit / Interest expense = 3 Interest expense = Operating profit / Interest cover = £3m / 3 = £1m Profit before tax = Operating profit - Interest expense = £3m - £1m = £2m"

    "title": "Cost of Capital",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Every investment undertaken by a company requires financing that is either sourced by debt or equity. Each source has a cost.\nThe cost of capital needs to be considered from two perspectives:\n\nInvestor Perspective: Cost of capital is the “opportunity cost” - the return that could be gained by investing funds in an alternative investment with similar risk characteristics.\nCompany Perspective: The “cost of capital” is the minimum return a company must provide to investors to ensure they continue to provide finance for investment and/or additional finance for future projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe return from a project should at least cover a company’s current cost of finance. Therefore, establishing the cost of capital is vital in the evaluation and selection of projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are four major forms of external long-term capital:\n\nOrdinary shares\nPreference shares\n\nLoan capital\nRedeemable debentures\n\nIn addition, an important form of internal long-term capital is retained earnings.\n\n\n\nThe cost of capital serves as the discount rate for investment appraisal and is calculated as the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), which combines:\n\nCost of debt\nCost of equity\n\nThe framework involves calculating each component separately:\n\nCost of DebtCost of Equity\n\n\nTwo main products of debt: - Bank loans - Redeemable debt\n\n\nTwo models to calculate the cost of equity (Ke): 1. Dividend growth model 2. Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity represents the owners’ investment in a company. This includes:\n\nIssued share capital (shown in financial statements)\nRetained earnings (often incorrectly viewed as a “free” source of finance)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRetained Earnings have an opportunity cost equal to the cost of equity (without issue costs). The market value of equity shares reflects the value placed on retained earnings by equity holders.\n\n\n\n\nA company’s equity should be valued as though it were being sourced from the markets today. This means:\n\nMarket price should not include premium to reflect a declared dividend payment\nPrice should be reduced to reflect the costs associated with issuing shares\n\nThe market value of equity (MV) is calculated as:\nMV = Share issue price × Number of shares currently in issue\nWhere ‘share issue price’ is the current long-run market price for each equity share (ex-dividend) less issue costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nEx-dividend vs Cum-dividend\n- Cum-dividend: Share price includes a premium for an upcoming dividend payment - Ex-dividend: Price after the dividend has been paid, without the dividend premium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1Example 2Example 3\n\n\nInvierno plc has two million issued equity shares. The current market price (cum dividend) is 240p per share. The accrued dividend is 22p per share.\nRequired: Calculate the market value of Invierno plc’s shares for WACC calculation.\nSolution:\nEx-div share price = £2.40 - £0.22 = £2.18\nMarket value = ex-div share price × number of shares = £2.18 × 2,000,000 = £4,360,000\n\n\nAlberta has 3 million shares in issue. The ordinary shares currently have a market value of £1.30 per share. Dividend of 5p per share has just been paid.\nSolution:\nMV = ex-div price × no of shares = 3,000,000 × £1.30 = £3,900,000\n\n\nBeta has 1 million shares in issue. The ordinary shares have a market value of £1.25 per share. Dividend of 3p per share was just announced and will be paid in a month.\nSolution:\nex-div price = £1.25 - £0.03 = £1.22\nMV = £1.22 × 1,000,000 = £1,220,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost of equity is generally calculated using one of two methods:\n\nDividend Models: Focus on the returns received by investors\nCapital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM): Focus on the returns required to compensate for risk, relative to other investments\n\n\n\nThis model is used to calculate the cost of preference shares which typically maintain a constant dividend.\n\\[K_e = \\frac{D_1}{P_0}\\]\nWhere: - P₀ is the market value of equity (ex-dividend) - D₁ is the annual dividend (assuming no growth in dividend payout) - Ke is the equity holders’ required return (company’s cost of equity)\n\n\n\nExample 1Example 2\n\n\nFebrero PLC pays an annual dividend of 16p per share. The preference shares are currently trading at 188p. An interim dividend of 8p is about to be paid.\nRequired: Calculate the cost of equity capital for Febrero PLC.\nSolution:\nAnnual dividend = £0.16\nEx-div = £1.88 - £0.08 = £1.80\nUsing dividend valuation model, Ke = £0.16/£1.80 = 8.89%\n\n\nHugo Plc pays an annual dividend of 24p per share. The shares are currently trading at £2.3 per share. Annual dividend has just been paid.\nSolution:\nAnnual div = £0.24\nEx-div price = £2.3\nKe = £0.24/£2.30 = 10.43%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a growth rate is estimated, this is factored into the dividend valuation model to provide a cost of equity that takes future dividend increases into consideration:\n\\[K_e = \\frac{D_1}{P_0} + g = \\frac{D_0(1+g)}{P_0} + g\\]\nWhere: - g is the growth rate - D₀ is the dividend that has just been paid - P₀ is the market value of equity (ex-dividend) - D₁ is the next expected dividend - Ke is the cost of equity capital\n\n\nThe formula for calculating historical dividend growth rate:\n\\[g = \\sqrt[y]{\\frac{D_{t0}}{D_{t0-y}}} - 1\\]\nWhere: - g is the growth rate - Dt0 is the dividend just paid - Dt0-y is the dividend paid “y” years ago\n\n\n\n\nExample 1Example 2Example 3\n\n\nJunio PLC had the following dividends over the past 5 years:\n\n\n\nYear\nDividends £\n\n\n\n\n2011\n195,000\n\n\n2012\n249,600\n\n\n2013\n267,800\n\n\n2014\n318,500\n\n\n2015\n341,055\n\n\n\nRequired: Calculate the growth in Junio PLC’s dividends.\nSolution: There are 5 years of dividends provided which means 4 years of dividend growth:\n341,055 = 195,000(1+g)⁴\n1.749 = (1+g)⁴\n(1.749)^0.25 = 1+g\ng = (1.749)^0.25 – 1 = 15%\n\n\nFebrero PLC pays an annual dividend of 16p per share. The shares are currently trading at 188p. The annual dividend has just been paid.\nRequired: Calculate the cost of equity capital for Febrero PLC. Assume a growth rate of 7%.\nSolution: Ex-div P₀ = £1.88\ng = 7%\nD₀ = £0.16\nD₁ = D₀(1+g) = £0.16 × 1.07 = £0.1712\nKe = (D₁/P₀) + g = (£0.1712/£1.88) + 7% = 9.11% + 7% = 16.11%\n\n\nWhiskey Plc just paid out a total of £300,000 as dividend. The shares are currently trading at £2.33 per share, and there are a total of 3 million shares. Assume there is a growth rate of 5%.\nSolution: P₀ = £2.33\nD₀ = £300,000/3,000,000 = £0.10 per share\nD₁ = D₀(1+g) = £0.10 × 1.05 = £0.105\nKe = (D₁/P₀) + g = (£0.105/2.33) + 5% = 4.5% + 5% = 9.5%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssumes dividends grow smoothly, but this may not reflect reality\nSome companies pay zero dividends and reinvest 100% of earnings\nAssumes dividends continue to grow at historic rates\nIgnores that shareholders also receive returns in the form of capital gains\nResults are very sensitive to values of g and P₀\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Capital Asset Pricing Model evaluates the risks associated with investing in a company relative to other capital market investments.\n\n\n\nUnsystematic (unique/business) risk: Specific to a company/industry (e.g., strike action, merger)\nSystematic (market) risk: Affects the whole market (e.g., inflation, interest rates, GDP movements)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPortfolio theory suggests that an investor can diversify away unsystematic risk by holding a well-diversified portfolio. The larger the number of differing types of shares held, the more likely that unsystematic risk will be reduced.\n\n\nIt is generally thought that holding eight to ten carefully chosen shares is sufficient to diversify away unsystematic risk.\n\n\n\nBeta (β) is a measure of the systematic risk of an individual equity share relative to the systematic risk experienced by the market.\n\nBeta = 1: Company has the same risk as the market average\nBeta &gt; 1: More risky than the market (e.g., β=2 means twice as risky)\nBeta &lt; 1: Less risky than the market\n\nA company’s beta is obtained by plotting the returns of the company against the returns of the market over time, creating a “securities market line.”\n\n\n\nThe CAPM captures the gradient of the securities market line:\n\\[r_j = r_f + \\beta(r_m - r_f)\\]\nWhere: - rj is the return expected from company j (same as Ke) - rf is the risk-free rate of return - β is the level of systematic risk - (rm – rf) is the market risk premium\n\n\n\nExample 1Example 2Example 3\n\n\nM plc has a beta factor of 1.2. The yield on government bonds is 3% and the return on the market is 8%.\nRequired: Calculate M plc’s equity cost of capital using CAPM.\nSolution: rf = 3%\nrm = 8%\nβ = 1.2\nrj = rf + β(rm - rf)\nrj = 3% + 1.2(8% - 3%)\nrj = 3% + 1.2(5%)\nrj = 3% + 6%\nrj = 9%\n\n\nL plc has a beta factor of 1.5.
