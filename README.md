   financial-management-website/
   ├── index.qmd                  # Homepage
   ├── _quarto.yml               # Site configuration
   ├── custom.scss               # Custom styling
   ├── slides/                   # Presentation slides
   │   └── day1.qmd              # Day 1 content
   │   └── day2.qmd              # Day 2 content
   │   └── day3.qmd              # Day 3 content
   │   └── day4.qmd              # Day 4 content
   ├── resources/                # Additional resources
   │   └── assessment.qmd        # Assessment details
   │   └── reading.qmd           # Reading list
   └── assets/                   # Images and other assets
   ```
