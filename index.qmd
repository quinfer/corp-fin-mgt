## AI Tools Policy ü§ñ

### Core Principle: LLM Premiums ‚â† Premium Thinking

While AI tools are part of the modern professional landscape, **paying for premium AI services does not generate premium thinking**. This module emphasizes developing your authentic analytical capabilities.

#### **Permitted Uses:**
- ‚úÖ Research assistance and concept clarification
- ‚úÖ Grammar checking and calculation verification
- ‚úÖ Understanding complex financial formulas

#### **Prohibited Uses:**
- ‚ùå Content generation for assignments
- ‚ùå AI-generated analysis or recommendations
- ‚ùå Substituting AI judgment for your critical thinking

#### **Key Warning:**
AI tools are "verbosity maximizers" - they excel at generating lots of words but often sacrifice precision and insight. Your goal is the opposite: **maximum insight with minimum words**.

:::{.callout-important}
**Reality Check**: ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, and other premium AI tools are optimized for engagement and volume, not academic precision. Experienced markers can readily identify AI-generated analysis.
