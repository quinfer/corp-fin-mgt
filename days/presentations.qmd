## Creating PDF Handouts

You can create PDF handouts directly from the RevealJS presentations:

1. **Using the Print Function**:
   - Open any presentation slides (e.g., ../slides/day1-morning-slides.html)
   - Press "P" to enter print mode
   - Use your browser's print function (Ctrl/Cmd+P)
   - Select "Save as PDF" as the destination
   - Configure as needed (landscape orientation recommended)
   - Click "Save" or "Print"

2. **Using Export Functions**:
   - Press "E" to enter speaker view
   - Look for the export options in the speaker notes panel
   - Select "Export to PDF"

3. **Customizing PDF Output**:
   - For handouts with multiple slides per page, use print settings
   - To include speaker notes, check "Include speaker notes" if available
   - Adjust margins and scaling as needed

## Updated Rendering Process

To generate all website content and slide presentations properly:

1. First, render the main website:
   ```bash
   quarto render
   ```

2. Then, render all the slide presentations:
   ```bash
   quarto render slides/day1-morning-slides.qmd --to revealjs
   quarto render slides/day1-afternoon-slides.qmd --to revealjs
   quarto render slides/day2-morning-slides.qmd --to revealjs
   quarto render slides/day2-afternoon-slides.qmd --to revealjs
   quarto render slides/day3-morning-slides.qmd --to revealjs
   quarto render slides/day3-afternoon-slides.qmd --to revealjs
   ```

This approach avoids conflicts between the HTML and RevealJS rendering processes.
