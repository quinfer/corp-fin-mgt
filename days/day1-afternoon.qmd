# Capital Investment Decision-Making

This afternoon, we build upon the financial framework and ratio analysis covered this morning to focus on one of the most critical aspects of financial management: capital investment decisions.

> **Learning Outcomes for This Session**
> By the end of this afternoon, you will be able to:
>
> 1. Explain the nature and importance of investment decision-making
> 2. Identify and evaluate the five main investment appraisal methods found in practice
> 3. Use these methods to reach decisions on investment opportunities
> 4. Explain the key stages in the investment decision-making process
> 5. Apply techniques to handle risk in investment decisions

## The Nature of Investment Decisions

Investment decisions represent long-term commitments of substantial resources with uncertain returns. They are among the most consequential decisions finance managers must make.

### Key Characteristics

Capital investment decisions typically involve:

- Substantial resource allocation
- Extended time horizons
- Limited reversibility once undertaken
- Strategic implications for the organisation's future direction
- Multiple risk dimensions

### Investment Decision Framework

### Real-World Example

The pharmaceutical industry provides a classic example of the capital investment decision challenge:

- Initial R&D investment: £500m+ (significant upfront capital)
- Development timeline: 10-15 years (extended time commitment)
- Success rate: Only 1 in 10 compounds receives regulatory approval (substantial uncertainty)
- Strategic importance: Defines company product pipeline for decades
- Market conditions: Subject to change during the development period

## Cash Flows vs. Accounting Profits

A fundamental principle in capital investment appraisal is the focus on cash flows rather than accounting profits.

### Understanding the Difference

**Cash flow definition**  
A cash flow represents the actual movement of money into or out of a business. It represents tangible and objective monetary transactions.

**Accounting profit definition**  
Accounting profit is a calculated figure based on matching revenues with expenses according to accounting principles. It includes non-cash items like depreciation.

**Key Equation:**
```
Cash Flow = Profit + Depreciation + Other non-cash adjustments
```

**Component explanation:**
- Begin with the accounting profit figure
- Add back depreciation (which was subtracted to calculate profit but didn't involve actual cash outflow)
- Add/subtract other non-cash items (like provisions or unrealized gains/losses)

**Practical example:** 
Consider a delivery van purchased for a business at £30,000. In accounting terms, this might be depreciated at £6,000 annually for 5 years. However, in cash flow terms, the entire £30,000 outflow occurs at purchase. In subsequent years, the accounting profit shows the £6,000 depreciation expense, but the cash flow doesn't reflect this—the cash outflow has already occurred.

### Why Focus on Cash Flows?

- **Objectivity**: Cash represents a measurable, tangible asset
- **Accounting variability**: Profits can differ based on accounting methods selected
- **Timing implications**: When cash flows occur directly impacts their value
- **Operational impact**: Investment decisions directly affect cash balances, influencing an organization's operational capabilities

### Relevant Cash Flows Are:

- **Incremental**: Cash flows arising directly because of the project
- **Future-oriented**: Past or "sunk" costs are irrelevant
- **After-tax**: Tax implications affect the actual cash benefit

### Irrelevant Items Include:

- **Sunk costs**: Previously committed expenditures that cannot be recovered
- **Non-incremental overhead allocations**: Fixed costs that would exist regardless of the new project
- **Interest payments**: These are captured in the discount rate used in evaluation
- **Accounting conventions**: Such as depreciation, which don't represent actual cash movements

> **Common Error to Avoid**
> 
> Including already committed (sunk) costs in investment appraisal calculations. Once spent, these costs are irrelevant to the decision to proceed.
>
> **Example**: If £50,000 has been spent on market research for a potential product, that £50,000 should not be included when deciding whether to launch the product. That expenditure is unrecoverable regardless of the decision.

## Projected Income Statement vs. Cash Flow

Consider how an accounting statement differs from the cash flow perspective:

**Typical Income Statement**

| Item | £000 | £000 |
|------|------|------|
| Credit sales revenue | 1,200 | |
| Less Cost of sales: | | |
|   Opening inventories | 100 | |
|   Add Purchases | 750 | |
|   Less Closing inventories | (120) | 730 |
| Gross profit | | 470 |
| Less: | | |
|   Credit card discounts | 60 | |
|   Rent and rates | 180 | |
|   Other costs | 240 | |
|   Depreciation of fittings | 140 | 620 |
| Profit for the period | | (150) |

**Converting to Cash Flow:**

1. The income statement shows a loss of £150,000
2. However, depreciation (£140,000) doesn't represent actual cash leaving the business
3. The inventory increase (£20,000) represents cash spent but not yet expensed
4. Credit sales (£1,200,000) may not all have been received in cash yet

To convert to cash flow:
- Start with the profit figure: -£150,000
- Add back non-cash expenses (depreciation): +£140,000
- Adjust for working capital changes (e.g., inventory increase): -£20,000
- Adjust for credit sales not yet received in cash: varies

The resulting figure represents the actual cash movement during the period, which may be significantly different from the accounting profit.

## A Practical Glossary of Key Terms

Before exploring investment appraisal methods, it's useful to clarify some key terminology:

- **Capital investment**: The allocation of funds to long-term assets or projects expected to generate value over multiple years
- **Cash flow**: The actual movement of money into or out of a business
- **Discount rate**: The rate used to convert future cash flows to present value, reflecting the time value of money and risk
- **Present value**: The current worth of a future cash flow, adjusted for the time value of money
- **Time value of money**: The concept that money available now is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential to earn returns
- **Incremental cash flow**: Additional cash flow occurring as a direct result of a decision
- **Sunk cost**: A cost already incurred that cannot be recovered
- **Opportunity cost**: The value of the next best alternative foregone when making a decision
- **Terminal value**: The estimated value of an asset or project at the end of a specific period
- **Risk premium**: The additional return expected for accepting additional risk

## Investment Appraisal Methods Overview

Five main methods are used in practice to evaluate investment projects:

### Classification Framework

```

    │   ├── Net Present Value (NPV)
    │   ├── Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
    │   └── Discounted Payback Period

    ├── Non-Discounted Cash Flow Methods
    │   └── Payback Period
    │
    └── Accounting Profit-Based
        └── Accounting Rate of Return
```

### Understanding the Time Value of Money Principle

Before exploring discounted cash flow methods, it's essential to understand the time value of money.

**The principle**: £100 today is worth more than £100 received in one year's time.

**Reasons:**
1. **Opportunity Cost**: Present funds can be invested to generate returns
2. **Inflation**: The purchasing power of money typically decreases over time
3. **Uncertainty**: Future cash receipts carry inherent uncertainty

**Example**: 
If funds can be invested at 5% annual interest, then:
- £100 today would grow to £105 in one year (£100 × 1.05)
- Therefore, £105 received one year from now is equivalent to having £100 today
- The "present value" of £105 received in one year is £100

This is calculated as: £105 ÷ 1.05 = £100

**Extension of this concept**:
- £100 today would grow to £110.25 in two years (£100 × 1.05 × 1.05)
- Therefore, £110.25 received two years from now is equivalent to having £100 today
- The present value of £110.25 received in two years is £100

This is calculated as: £110.25 ÷ (1.05)² = £110.25 ÷ 1.1025 = £100

DCF methods explicitly account for this through discounting.

### Selection in Practice

[Graph showing trends in investment appraisal method usage over time]

The graph would show that over the past two decades:
- Net Present Value (NPV) usage has been steadily increasing
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR) usage has been growing even faster
- Payback Period (PP) usage has been gradually declining
- Accounting Rate of Return (ARR) usage has been declining more rapidly

## Payback Period (PP)

The Payback Period is the time required to recover the initial investment from project cash flows.

### Definition & Calculation

The Payback Period tells us the duration required for cumulative cash inflows to equal the initial investment.

**Formula**:
```
Payback Period = Time until ∑ Cash Flows = 0
```

In methodological terms: Calculate the cumulative cash flows (starting with the negative initial investment) until the total becomes positive. The point at which this occurs is the payback period.

**Decision Rule**:
- Accept projects with PP < maximum acceptable period
- Between competing projects, prefer shorter payback
- The "maximum acceptable period" is typically established by organizational policy

### Step-by-Step Example

A project costs £500,000 with the following expected cash flows:

| Year | Cash Flow (£) | Cumulative Cash Flow (£) |
|------|--------------|--------------------------|
| 0    | -500,000     | -500,000                |
| 1    | 150,000      | -350,000                |
| 2    | 180,000      | -170,000                |
| 3    | 200,000      | 30,000                  |
| 4    | 120,000      | 150,000                 |
| 5    | 100,000      | 250,000                 |

**Step 1**: Begin with the initial investment as a negative cash flow (Year 0)

**Step 2**: Add each year's cash flow to calculate a running total

**Step 3**: Determine when the cumulative total becomes positive (between Years 2 and 3)

**Step 4**: Calculate the precise payback period:
- At the end of Year 2, £170,000 remains to be recovered
- Year 3 generates £200,000
- The proportion of Year 3 needed is: £170,000 ÷ £200,000 = 0.85
- Therefore, Payback Period = 2 + 0.85 = 2.85 years

**Visual Representation**:
```
Cumulative Cash Flow
£250,000 |                                    /
£150,000 |                           /------/
 £30,000 |                  /-------/
        0|----------------/-----------------
-£170,000|         /-----/
-£350,000|  /-----/
-£500,000|--/----------------------------------
           0      1      2      3      4      5
                              ↑
                         Payback Point (2.85 years)
```

### Advantages & Limitations

**Advantages**:
- **Computational simplicity**
- **Focus on liquidity and capital recovery**
- **Basic risk indicator**
- **Practical application frequency**

**Limitations**:
- **Disregards cash flows beyond the payback period**
- **Neglects time value of money**
- **Fails to consider investment scale**
- **Often employs arbitrary thresholds**
- **Not aligned with shareholder wealth maximization**

## Discounted Payback Period (DPP)

The Discounted Payback Period addresses a key limitation of the standard payback by considering the time value of money.

### Definition & Calculation

The Discounted Payback Period indicates the duration required for cumulative discounted cash inflows to equal the initial investment.

**Formula**:
```
Discounted Payback Period = Time until ∑ [Cash Flow_t / (1+r)^t] = 0
```

Where:
- t = time period (typically years)
- r = discount rate
- The notation (1+r)^t means (1+r) raised to the power of t

Methodological process: 
1. Convert all future cash flows to their present value (by discounting with factor (1+r)^t)
2. Calculate the cumulative discounted cash flows (starting with the initial investment)
3. The point at which the cumulative total becomes positive is the discounted payback period

**Decision Rule**:
- Accept projects with DPP < maximum acceptable period
- Between competing projects, prefer shorter discounted payback

### Understanding the Discounting Process

Before proceeding to the example, it's important to understand the discounting calculation:

**Discount factor**: The multiplier applied to future cash flows to determine present value

For a discount rate of 10%:
- Year 1 discount factor: 1 ÷ (1+0.10)¹ = 1 ÷ 1.10 = 0.909
- Year 2 discount factor: 1 ÷ (1+0.10)² = 1 ÷ 1.21 = 0.826
- Year 3 discount factor: 1 ÷ (1+0.10)³ = 1 ÷ 1.331 = 0.751
- And so on...

**Graphical representation of discount factors over time**:
```
1.000 |*
0.909 | *
0.826 |  *
0.751 |   *
0.683 |    *
0.621 |     *
      +------
      0 1 2 3 4 5
         Years
```

The discount factor decreases as time extends further into the future, reflecting the diminishing present value of future cash flows.

### Step-by-Step Example

Using the same project with a 10% discount rate:

| Year | Cash Flow (£) | Discount Factor | Discounted CF (£) | Cumulative DCF (£) |
|------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 0    | -500,000     | 1.000          | -500,000          | -500,000         |
| 1    | 150,000      | 0.909          | 136,350           | -363,650         |
| 2    | 180,000      | 0.826          | 148,680           | -214,970         |
| 3    | 200,000      | 0.751          | 150,200           | -64,770          |
| 4    | 120,000      | 0.683          | 81,960            | 17,190           |
| 5    | 100,000      | 0.621          | 62,100            | 79,290           |

**Step 1**: Calculate the discount factor for each year using the formula 1/(1+r)^t
- Year 1: 1/(1.10)¹ = 0.909
- Year 2: 1/(1.10)² = 0.826
- And so on...

**Step 2**: Calculate the discounted cash flow by multiplying each cash flow by its discount factor
- Year 0: -£500,000 × 1.000 = -£500,000
- Year 1: £150,000 × 0.909 = £136,350
- And so on...

**Step 3**: Calculate the cumulative discounted cash flow
- Year 0: -£500,000
- Year 1: -£500,000 + £136,350 = -£363,650
- And so on...

**Step 4**: Determine when the cumulative total becomes positive (between Years 3 and 4)

**Step 5**: Calculate the precise discounted payback period:
- At the end of Year 3, £64,770 remains to be recovered
- Year 4 generates a discounted cash flow of £81,960
- The proportion of Year 4 required is: £64,770 ÷ £81,960 = 0.79
- Therefore, Discounted Payback Period = 3 + 0.79 = 3.79 years

**Note**: The calculation in the original table showed 3.20 years, but our worked example shows 3.79 years. For teaching purposes, we'll use our calculated value of 3.79 years.

### Advantages & Limitations

**Advantages**:
- **Incorporates time value of money**: Unlike standard PP
- **Maintains interpretative simplicity**: Still provides a clear metric for capital recovery
- **More accurate measure of recovery period**: Based on the actual value of money over time

**Limitations**:
- **Still disregards cash flows after the payback period**: May miss substantial future returns
- **Arbitrary threshold selection**: The "acceptable" discounted payback period often lacks objective basis
- **Not directly linked to shareholder wealth maximization**: Doesn't necessarily indicate value creation

### Visual Comparison: PP vs. DPP

```
Cumulative Cash Flow
£250,000 |                                    /
         |                           /------/
         |                  /-------/
       0 |----------------/-----------------
         |         /-----/
         |  /-----/
-£500,000|--/----------------------------------
           0      1      2      3      4      5
                  ↑                ↑
               Payback         Discounted
              (2.85 years)       Payback
                              (3.79 years)
```

The discounted payback period exceeds the regular payback period. This relationship is consistently true because discounting reduces the present value of future cash flows.

## Net Present Value (NPV)

The Net Present Value method is the most theoretically sound approach to investment appraisal, directly linking to shareholder wealth maximization.

### Definition & Calculation

Net Present Value represents the sum of all project cash flows, discounted to present value.

**Formula**:
```
NPV = ∑ [Cash Flow_t / (1+r)^t]
```

Where:
- t = time period (typically years)
- r = discount rate (cost of capital)
- ∑ symbol means "sum of all terms"

Methodological process:
1. Convert all cash flows to present value using the appropriate discount rate
2. Sum all discounted cash flows (including the initial investment)
3. The resulting figure represents the net value created by the project in present terms

**Decision Rule**:
- Accept projects with NPV > 0 (project creates value)
- Reject projects with NPV < 0 (project destroys value)
- Between competing projects, prefer higher NPV

### Understanding the Discount Rate

The discount rate used in NPV calculations is crucial and reflects several components:

```
Discount rate components:
- Risk-free rate (time value of money)
- Inflation premium
- Risk premium
```

**Risk-free rate**: The return available on risk-free investments (typically government securities)

**Inflation premium**: Adjustment for expected decrease in purchasing power

**Risk premium**: Additional return required to compensate for project-specific risk

**Example**:
- Risk-free rate: 2%
- Expected inflation: 3%
- Project risk premium: 5%
- Resulting discount rate: 2% + 3% + 5% = 10%

The discount rate effectively establishes the minimum acceptable return for the project.

### Step-by-Step Example

Using our same project with a 10% discount rate:

| Year | Cash Flow (£) | Discount Factor | Discounted CF (£) |
|------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 0    | -500,000     | 1.000          | -500,000          |
| 1    | 150,000      | 0.909          | 136,350           |
| 2    | 180,000      | 0.826          | 148,680           |
| 3    | 200,000      | 0.751          | 150,200           |
| 4    | 120,000      | 0.683          | 81,960            |
| 5    | 100,000      | 0.621          | 62,100            |

**Step 1**: Calculate the discount factor for each year using the formula 1/(1+r)^t
- Year 0: 1/(1.10)⁰ = 1.000 (no discounting for present money)
- Year 1: 1/(1.10)¹ = 0.909
- Year 2: 1/(1.10)² = 0.826
- And so on...

**Step 2**: Calculate the discounted cash flow by multiplying each cash flow by its discount factor
- Year 0: -£500,000 × 1.000 = -£500,000
- Year 1: £150,000 × 0.909 = £136,350
- And so on...

**Step 3**: Sum all the discounted cash flows to derive the NPV
- NPV = -£500,000 + £136,350 + £148,680 + £150,200 + £81,960 + £62,100 = £79,290

Since the NPV is positive (£79,290), the project creates value and should be accepted.

### Interpretative Framework for NPV

**NPV interpretation**: 
- If NPV = £79,290, the project generates £79,290 more value in present terms than an alternative investment at the discount rate
- It represents the additional value created beyond the required return

**Alternative perspective**: 
- If presented with two options:
  - Deposit £500,000 in an investment yielding 10% annually, or
  - Invest £500,000 in this project
- The positive NPV of £79,290 indicates the project delivers greater value than the alternative investment

### Advantages & Limitations

**Advantages**:
- **Considers all cash flows over project life**: No arbitrary cutoff point
- **Incorporates time value of money**: Appropriately values future cash flows
- **Directly linked to shareholder wealth maximization**: Positive NPV indicates increased shareholder value
- **Allows for risk adjustment via discount rate**: Higher-risk projects can be evaluated with higher discount rates
- **Additive across projects**: NPVs of multiple projects can be aggregated

**Limitations**:
- **Greater computational complexity**: Requires understanding of discounting methods
- **Sensitivity to discount rate selection**: Minor changes in discount rate can significantly impact NPV
- **Assumes reinvestment at the discount rate**: May not always reflect reality
- **Provides absolute rather than relative measure**: Doesn't indicate capital efficiency

## Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

The Internal Rate of Return is the discount rate at which a project's NPV equals zero, representing the project's "yield."

### Definition & Calculation

The Internal Rate of Return represents the discount rate that equates the present value of cash inflows with the present value of cash outflows.

**Formula**:
IRR is the value of r that satisfies:

```
∑ [Cash Flow_t / (1+r)^t] = 0
```

Methodological process:
1. Determine the discount rate at which NPV equals exactly zero
2. This rate represents the project's effective return rate
3. At this exact rate, the investment would be financially neutral

**Decision Rule**:
- Accept projects with IRR > cost of capital
- Reject projects with IRR < cost of capital
- Between competing projects, prefer higher IRR

### Understanding IRR Conceptually

**IRR interpretation**:
- Represents the project's internal efficiency or yield
- Comparable to an effective interest rate on the investment
- If IRR exceeds the cost of capital, the project creates value

**Mathematical solution**:
- Unlike NPV, no direct formula exists to calculate IRR
- Requires iterative calculation or financial software
- Solves for the discount rate that results in NPV = 0

### Step-by-Step Example

Using the same project cash flows:

| Year | Cash Flow (£) |
|------|--------------|
| 0    | -500,000     |
| 1    | 150,000      |
| 2    | 180,000      |
| 3    | 200,000      |
| 4    | 120,000      |
| 5    | 100,000      |

To find the IRR, we need to determine the value of r where:

-500,000 + 150,000/(1+r)¹ + 180,000/(1+r)² + 200,000/(1+r)³ + 120,000/(1+r)⁴ + 100,000/(1+r)⁵ = 0

**Iterative Approach**:
1. Begin with r = 15%
   - NPV = -£36,764 (negative)
2. Try r = 12%
   - NPV = £13,477 (positive)
3. Try r = 14%
   - NPV = -£16,025 (negative)
4. Try r = 13%
   - NPV = -£2,048 (negative)
5. Try r = 12.5%
   - NPV = £5,477 (positive)
6. Try r = 12.8%
   - NPV = £560 (positive)
7. Try r = 12.9%
   - NPV = -£1,088 (negative)

Through this iterative process, we can estimate that IRR ≈ 12.85%

Since IRR (12.85%) > Cost of capital (10%), the project is acceptable.

### Visual Understanding: NPV-IRR Relationship

```

The graph illustrates NPV at different discount rates. The point where the line intersects the x-axis represents the IRR.

**Key insights from this graph**:
- At discount rates below IRR, NPV is positive
- At discount rates above IRR, NPV is negative
- At exactly IRR, NPV is zero

### Advantages & Limitations

**Advantages**:
- **Percentage format aids interpretation**: Managers often find percentage returns more intuitive than absolute values
- **Incorporates time value of money**: Appropriately values future cash flows
- **Considers complete cash flow profile**: Includes all project cash flows
- **Widespread professional application**: Commonly used in business contexts

**Limitations**:
- **Multiple IRRs possible with non-conventional cash flows**: If cash flows change direction more than once
- **Scale of investment not considered**: A smaller project might have a higher IRR but create less total value
- **Reinvestment assumption may be unrealistic**: Assumes cash flows can be reinvested at the IRR
- **Potential ranking conflicts with NPV**: May produce different project rankings than NPV
- **Indirect relationship to shareholder wealth maximization**: A high IRR doesn't necessarily maximize value

### Real-World Example: When IRR and NPV Conflict

Consider two mutually exclusive projects:

| Project | Initial Investment | Cash Flow Year 1 | IRR    | NPV (at 10%) |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|--------|--------------|
| Small   | -£10,000          | £13,000          | 30%    | £1,818       |
| Large   | -£100,000         | £115,000         | 15%    | £4,545       |

**IRR Ranking**: Small Project (30%) > Large Project (15%)
**NPV Ranking**: Large Project (£4,545) > Small Project (£1,818)

**Analysis**: NPV provides the better guide to value creation. The large project creates more total wealth, even though its percentage return is lower.

## Accounting Rate of Return (ARR)

The Accounting Rate of Return focuses on accounting profit rather than cash flows.

### Definition & Calculation

The Accounting Rate of Return tells us: "What is the average accounting return on the investment?"

**Formula**:
```
ARR = (Average annual profit / Average investment) × 100%
```

Where:
- Average annual profit = Total project profits ÷ Project life
- Average investment = (Initial investment + Residual value) ÷ 2

In plain English:
1. Calculate the average annual accounting profit over the project's life
2. Calculate the average investment over the project's life
3. Divide the average profit by the average investment to get the return rate

**Decision Rule**:
- Accept projects with ARR > minimum required return
- Reject projects with ARR < minimum required return
- Between competing projects, prefer higher ARR

### Understanding the Difference from Cash Flow Methods

Unlike NPV and IRR, ARR uses accounting profits, which:
- Include non-cash items like depreciation
- Follow accounting conventions that may vary between companies
- Don't consider the timing of cash flows

This makes it fundamentally different from discounted cash flow methods.

### Step-by-Step Example

A project requires an initial investment of £500,000 with the following profit projections:

| Year | Accounting Profit (£) |
|------|----------------------|
| 1    | 90,000               |
| 2    | 110,000              |
| 3    | 130,000              |
| 4    | 80,000               |
| 5    | 70,000               |

With a residual value of £100,000.

**Step 1**: Calculate the total and average annual profit
- Total profit = £90,000 + £110,000 + £130,000 + £80,000 + £70,000 = £480,000
- Average annual profit = £480,000 ÷ 5 = £96,000

**Step 2**: Calculate the average investment
- Initial investment = £500,000
- Residual value = £100,000
- Average investment = (£500,000 + £100,000) ÷ 2 = £300,000

**Step 3**: Calculate the ARR
- ARR = (£96,000 ÷ £300,000) × 100% = 32%

**Note**: The ARR of 32% cannot be directly compared with the IRR of 12.85% from our previous example, as they measure different things.

### Advantages & Limitations

**Advantages**:
- **Uses familiar accounting concepts**: No need to convert to cash flows
- **Simple to calculate**: Basic arithmetic only
- **Addresses profitability directly**: Based on accounting profit, which is familiar to managers
- **No discounting required**: Avoids complexity of time value calculations

**Limitations**:
- **Based on accounting profits, not cash flows**: May not reflect actual cash generation
- **Ignores time value of money**: Treats profits in Year 1 the same as profits in Year 5
- **No objective benchmark for minimum ARR**: What's a "good" ARR is often arbitrary
- **Sensitive to accounting policies**: Different depreciation methods can change the ARR
- **Multiple calculation methods exist**: Different companies may calculate it differently

## Comparing Appraisal Methods Using a Simple Example

Let's use a very simple example to see how each method evaluates a project:

**Project X**: Initial investment of £1,000 with the following cash flows:
- Year 1: £500
- Year 2: £600
- Year 3: £400

Cost of capital (discount rate): 10%

### Payback Period (PP)
Initial investment: £1,000
- Year 1: £500 (Cumulative: £500)
- Year 2: £600 (Cumulative: £1,100)

Payback Period = 1 + (£1,000 - £500)/£600 = 1 + 0.83 = 1.83 years

### Discounted Payback Period (DPP)
Initial investment: £1,000
- Year 1: £500 × 0.909 = £454.50 (Cumulative: £454.50)
- Year 2: £600 × 0.826 = £495.60 (Cumulative: £950.10)
- Year 3: £400 × 0.751 = £300.40 (Cumulative: £1,250.50)

Discounted Payback Period = 2 + (£1,000 - £950.10)/£300.40 = 2 + 0.17 = 2.17 years

### Net Present Value (NPV)
NPV = -£1,000 + £454.50 + £495.60 + £300.40 = £250.50

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
Finding the discount rate where:
-£1,000 + £500/(1+r)¹ + £600/(1+r)² + £400/(1+r)³ = 0

Using financial calculator: IRR = 22.1%

### Accounting Rate of Return (ARR)
Assuming straight-line depreciation over 3 years and zero residual value:
- Annual depreciation = £1,000 ÷ 3 = £333.33
- Accounting profits:
  - Year 1: £500 - £333.33 = £166.67
  - Year 2: £600 - £333.33 = £266.67
  - Year 3: £400 - £333.33 = £66.67
- Average annual profit = (£166.67 + £266.67 + £66.67) ÷ 3 = £166.67
- Average investment = (£1,000 + £0) ÷ 2 = £500
- ARR = (£166.67 ÷ £500) × 100% = 33.3%

### Summary of Methods for Project X

| Method | Result | Decision (assuming standard criteria) |
|--------|--------|---------------------------------------|
| PP     | 1.83 years | Accept if PP < 2 years                |
| DPP    | 2.17 years | Accept if DPP < 3 years               |
| NPV    | £250.50   | Accept (positive NPV)                 |
| IRR    | 22.1%    | Accept (IRR > 10% cost of capital)     |
| ARR    | 33.3%    | Accept if ARR > 15% target return      |

This simple example shows how all five methods evaluate the same project, highlighting their different approaches and results.

## Comparison of Appraisal Methods

The following table summarizes key features of the five investment appraisal methods:

| Method | Considers Time Value | Considers All Cash Flows | Linked to Shareholder Value | Complexity | Format |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------|--------|
| Payback Period (PP) | No | No | No | Low | Years |
| Discounted Payback Period (DPP) | Yes | No | No | Medium | Years |
| Net Present Value (NPV) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Medium-High | Currency |
| Internal Rate of Return (IRR) | Yes | Yes | Indirectly | High | Percentage |
| Accounting Rate of Return (ARR) | No | Yes | No | Low | Percentage |

> **Best Practice**
> 
> Organizations typically use multiple appraisal methods in combination to gain a more complete perspective on potential investments.

### Which Method Should You Use?

**For maximizing shareholder value**: NPV is theoretically the best method as it directly measures value creation

**For comparing projects of different sizes**: NPV for total value created, IRR for efficiency of capital use

**For communicating with non-financial managers**: Payback Period and IRR are more intuitive

**For quick screening of proposals**: Payback Period can be calculated easily to filter out poor investments

**For comprehensiveness**: Use multiple methods to get different perspectives on the investment

## Case Study: Evaluating a New Business Venture

Let's apply these methods to a real-world case:

**Evaluating the Potential of Starting a Plumbing Business**

### Business Plan Overview

The proposal involves:

- **Year 0**: Initial investment (Equipment: £25,000, Van: £15,000, Advertising: £5,000)
- **Years 1-5**: Operations (Building customer base, hiring employees)
- **End of Year 5**: Exit strategy (Sell business for £30,000, equipment value £8,000, van value £3,000)

Expected cash flows:
- Year 1: £12,000
- Year 2: £18,000
- Year 3: £22,000
- Year 4: £25,000
- Year 5: £26,000 (plus exit values)

### Applying PP and DPP

| Year | Cash Flow (£) | Cumulative CF (£) | Discount Factor | Discounted CF (£) | Cumulative DCF (£) |
|------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 0    | -45,000      | -45,000           | 1.000          | -45,000           | -45,000           |
| 1    | 12,000       | -33,000           | 0.909          | 10,908            | -34,092           |
| 2    | 18,000       | -15,000           | 0.826          | 14,868            | -19,224           |
| 3    | 22,000       | 7,000             | 0.751          | 16,522            | -2,702            |
| 4    | 25,000       | 32,000            | 0.683          | 17,075            | 14,373            |
| 5    | 67,000       | 99,000            | 0.621          | 41,607            | 55,980            |

**Calculating Payback Period**:
- At the end of Year 2, we're still £15,000 short of breaking even
- In Year 3, we generate £22,000
- The fraction of Year 3 needed is: £15,000 ÷ £22,000 = 0.68
- Therefore, Payback Period = 2 + 0.68 = 2.68 years

**Calculating Discounted Payback Period**:
- At the end of Year 3, we're still £2,702 short of breaking even
- In Year 4, we generate discounted cash flow of £17,075
- The fraction of Year 4 needed is: £2,702 ÷ £17,075 = 0.16
- Therefore, Discounted Payback Period = 3 + 0.16 = 3.16 years

### Calculating NPV and IRR

**Net Present Value (NPV)**:
Sum of all discounted cash flows = £55,980

**Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**:
Finding the discount rate where:
-£45,000 + £12,000/(1+r)¹ + £18,000/(1+r)² + £22,000/(1+r)³ + £25,000/(1+r)⁴ + £67,000/(1+r)⁵ = 0

Using financial calculator: IRR = 33.5%

### Calculating ARR

| Year | Cash Flow (£) | Depreciation (£) | Accounting Profit (£) |
|------|--------------|------------------|----------------------|
| 1    | 12,000       | 800              | 11,200               |
| 2    | 18,000       | 800              | 17,200               |
| 3    | 22,000       | 800              | 21,200               |
| 4    | 25,000       | 800              | 24,200               |
| 5    | 26,000       | 800              | 25,200               |

**Step 1**: Calculate depreciation (assuming straight-line)
- Total value to depreciate = Initial investment - Residual value = £45,000 - £41,000 = £4,000
- Annual depreciation = £4,000 ÷ 5 = £800

**Step 2**: Calculate accounting profits by subtracting depreciation from cash flows

**Step 3**: Calculate average annual profit
- Total accounting profit = £11,200 + £17,200 + £21,200 + £24,200 + £25,200 = £99,000
- Average annual profit = £99,000 ÷ 5 = £19,800

**Step 4**: Calculate average investment
- Average investment = (£45,000 + £41,000) ÷ 2 = £43,000

**Step 5**: Calculate ARR
- ARR = (£19,800 ÷ £43,000) × 100% = 46.0%

### Decision Recommendation

Based on all five appraisal methods, we can make the following assessment:

1. **Payback Period (2.68 years)**: If the maximum acceptable payback is 3 years, the project is acceptable.

2. **Discounted Payback (3.16 years)**: If the maximum acceptable discounted payback is 4 years, the project is acceptable.

3. **NPV (£55,980)**: The positive NPV indicates the project adds substantial value to the business and should be accepted.

4. **IRR (33.5%)**: If the cost of capital is 10%, the project's IRR substantially exceeds this threshold and should be accepted.

5. **ARR (46.0%)**: If the minimum required ARR is 15%, the project is well above this threshold and acceptable.

**Recommendation**: The investment in the plumbing business appears financially viable across all appraisal methods. The positive NPV and high IRR are particularly encouraging indicators of value creation.

## Risk in Investment Decisions

Investment decisions inherently involve risk and uncertainty. Several methods exist to incorporate risk assessment into the appraisal process.

### Risk Assessment Approaches

```
Risk Assessment Methods
├── Sensitivity Analysis
├── Scenario Analysis
├── Risk-Adjusted Discount Rate
├── Probability-Based Methods
│   ├── Expected NPV
│   └── Monte Carlo Simulation
└── Real Options Analysis
```

### Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis examines how changes in key variables affect project outcomes.

**Process**:
1. Identify key variables (e.g., sales volume, price, costs)
2. Calculate impact of percentage changes in each variable
3. Identify switching points where NPV becomes zero
4. Focus management attention on most sensitive variables

**Example**: For our plumbing business, how much would each variable need to change to make NPV zero?

| Variable | Base Value | Change for Zero NPV | Interpretation |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| Initial investment | £45,000 | +124.4% | Low sensitivity |
| Annual cash flows | As projected | -43.7% | Moderate sensitivity |
| Exit value | £41,000 | -136.5% | Low sensitivity |
| Discount rate | 10% | +23.5 percentage points | Low sensitivity |

**Interpreting the results**:
- The project's NPV would become zero if:
  - Initial investment increased by 124.4% (to £100,980)
  - Annual cash flows decreased by 43.7% (nearly halved)
  - Exit value decreased by 136.5% (becoming negative, which is unrealistic)
  - Discount rate increased to 33.5% (from 10%)

Since most of these changes are extreme, the project appears robust to reasonable variations.

### Scenario Analysis

Scenario analysis evaluates the project under different sets of assumptions.

| Scenario | Annual Growth | Exit Multiple | NPV | IRR |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-----|-----|
| Pessimistic | 5% | 1.0x | £10,250 | 15.1% |
| Most likely | 10% | 1.5x | £55,980 | 33.5% |
| Optimistic | 15% | 2.0x | £112,350 | 48.2% |

**Interpreting the results**:
- Even in the pessimistic scenario, the project has a positive NPV and IRR above the cost of capital
- This suggests the project is relatively low-risk

### Expected NPV

Expected NPV incorporates probability estimates for different outcomes.

| Scenario | Probability | NPV | Weighted NPV |
|----------|------------|-----|-------------|
| Pessimistic | 0.25 | £10,250 | £2,563 |
| Most likely | 0.50 | £55,980 | £27,990 |
| Optimistic | 0.25 | £112,350 | £28,088 |
| Expected value | 1.00 |  | £58,641 |

**Interpreting the results**:
- The expected NPV (£58,641) represents the probability-weighted average outcome
- Since this is positive, the project is expected to create value even after accounting for different scenarios

### Risk Attitudes

Different investors have different risk preferences:

- **Risk-averse** investors: Require compensation for bearing risk
- **Risk-neutral** investors: Focus solely on expected values
- **Risk-seeking** investors: Willing to accept lower expected returns for chance of higher gains

Most corporate decision-makers are risk-averse, which is reflected in:
- Use of hurdle rates above the cost of capital
- Preference for shorter payback periods
- Conservative cash flow projections

## Investment Decision Process in Practice

The investment appraisal techniques are part of a broader investment decision-making process:

```
1. Determine available funds
         ↓
2. Identify investment opportunities
         ↓
3. Initial screening
         ↓
4. Detailed appraisal
         ↓
5. Accept/reject decision
         ↓
6. Implementation
         ↓
7. Post-implementation review
```

> **Non-Financial Factors**
> 
> Financial appraisal provides essential input but should be complemented with consideration of:
>
> - Strategic fit with organizational objectives
> - Market position and competitive impacts
> - Technical feasibility and resource availability
> - Environmental, social, and governance factors
> - Regulatory compliance requirements
> - Organizational capability and change management

## Post-Completion Audit

After implementing capital investments, organizations should conduct post-completion audits to:

- Compare actual outcomes with projected performance
- Identify reasons for discrepancies
- Improve future forecasting and decision-making
- Create accountability for projections
- Capture learning for future investments

> **Best Practice**
> 
> Research shows that companies conducting systematic post-completion audits achieve:
> - More accurate future projections
> - Better investment performance
> - Improved organizational learning
> - Enhanced strategic alignment of investments

## Key Takeaways

- Investment decisions are among the most consequential in financial management, committing substantial resources for extended periods with uncertain returns

- Cash flows, not accounting profits, are the basis for sound investment appraisal because they represent actual monetary value movements

- NPV is the most theoretically sound method, directly linked to shareholder value by calculating the present value of all future cash flows

- Multiple appraisal methods should be used in combination for a complete perspective, as each provides different insights into the investment opportunity

- Risk assessment is an essential component of investment decision-making, helping to quantify uncertainties and test the robustness of projections

- The broader organizational and strategic context must be considered alongside financial analysis, as investments must support overall business objectives

- Post-completion audits improve future decision-making by creating feedback loops for organizational learning

## Real Options in Capital Investment Decisions

Real options analysis recognises that investment decisions often contain embedded options that can significantly impact project value.

### Real Options Framework

Real options represent flexibility in decision-making. Unlike financial options (which give the right to buy or sell financial assets), real options give managers the right to make business decisions.

```
Real Options in Investment
├── Option to Defer
├── Option to Expand
├── Option to Abandon
├── Option to Contract
└── Option to Switch
```

Real options create value through managerial flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances.

### Understanding Real Options Through an Analogy

**Analogy: House Construction Project**

Think of real options like building a house in stages:

1. **Option to Defer**: You buy land but wait to start construction until property prices rise
   - You've paid something (land cost) to create future flexibility

2. **Option to Expand**: You build extra-deep foundations that would allow adding a second story later
   - You spend more now for the option to expand cheaply later

3. **Option to Abandon**: You design the house so it could easily be sold as a commercial property
   - You've created an "exit strategy" if residential plans don't work out

4. **Option to Contract**: You design the house with a separate suite that could be rented out
   - You've created flexibility to scale back your personal space if needed

5. **Option to Switch**: You install systems that allow the house to use either gas or electric heating
   - You've created flexibility to switch between energy sources based on prices

### Common Real Option Types

| Option Type | Description | Value Driver | Business Example |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Defer | Ability to postpone investment | Reduces uncertainty before committing | Oil company delaying field development until prices rise |
| Expand | Opportunity to increase scale | Captures upside potential | E-commerce firm building oversized warehouse for future growth |
| Abandon | Ability to exit unprofitable projects | Limits downside risk | Pharmaceutical company stopping drug development after poor trial results |
| Contract | Option to reduce project scale | Mitigates losses in adverse conditions | Airline reducing fleet size during travel downturns |
| Switch | Flexibility to change inputs/outputs | Adapts to changing market conditions | Manufacturing plant that can produce different products |

### How Real Options Add Value

Traditional NPV analysis often undervalues projects because it:
- Assumes decisions are made now with no future flexibility
- Doesn't account for management's ability to adapt to new information

**Example: Mining Project**

Traditional NPV analysis:
- Initial investment: £50 million
- Expected cash flows (present value): £45 million
- NPV: -£5 million (would reject project)

Real options analysis recognises:
- Option to delay production if metal prices are low
- Option to expand production if prices rise significantly
- Option to abandon if costs exceed projections

After accounting for these options, the project might have a positive value despite negative traditional NPV.

### Valuation Approaches

Real options can be valued using:

1. **Black-Scholes Model**: Originally developed for financial options, can be adapted for simple real options
   - Works best when there's a clear exercise date and price

2. **Binomial Lattice**: Maps out possible future scenarios and decision points
   - Better for complex options with multiple decision points

3. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Uses thousands of random scenarios to estimate option value
   - Best for highly uncertain situations with multiple variables

### Practical Example in Stages

A mining company considering a new site can view the investment as a series of options:

**Stage 1: Exploration (Option to Defer)**
- Cost: £1 million for initial exploration
- Creates option to develop if resources found
- If no resources, lose £1 million
- If resources found, move to Stage 2

**Stage 2: Development (Option to Expand/Contract)**
- Cost: £20 million to develop the mine
- Creates option to extract at different scales
- Can choose small-scale (£10m) or large-scale (£20m) development

**Stage 3: Extraction (Option to Switch/Abandon)**
- Can adjust extraction rate based on mineral prices
- Can temporarily halt production if prices fall too low
- Can sell the mine if prospects deteriorate permanently

This staged approach allows management to:
1. Limit initial exposure (only £1m at first)
2. Make informed decisions as uncertainty resolves
3. Capture upside potential while limiting downside risk

## Capital Rationing Decision Tree

When facing capital constraints, a structured approach helps maximise value creation.

### Understanding Capital Rationing

**Capital rationing** occurs when a company cannot fund all profitable projects (those with positive NPV).

**Two types of capital rationing:**
- **Soft rationing**: Internal policy constraints (e.g., debt limits set by management)
- **Hard rationing**: External market constraints (e.g., inability to raise capital)

### Decision Framework

```

     Mathematical Programming
```

### Profitability Index: A Key Tool for Capital Rationing

When you can't fund all profitable projects, you need to know which provide the most "bang for your buck."

**Profitability Index (PI)** measures the value created per pound invested:

```
PI = Present Value of Future Cash Flows / Initial Investment
```

**Mathematical breakdown:**
```
PI = ∑[Cash Flow_t / (1+r)^t] / Initial Investment
```

Where:
- t = time period (typically years)
- r = discount rate

**In simpler terms:**
- Calculate the present value of all future cash inflows
- Divide by the initial investment amount

**Interpreting the result:**
- PI > 1.0: Project creates value (accept if possible)
- PI = 1.0: Project breaks even (indifferent)
- PI < 1.0: Project destroys value (reject)

### Example of Profitability Index Calculation

Consider three projects with capital constraint of £500,000:

| Project | Initial Investment | NPV | PI | Ranking |
|---------|-------------------|-----|-------|--------|
| A | £200,000 | £40,000 | 1.20 | 2 |
| B | £300,000 | £90,000 | 1.30 | 1 |
| C | £250,000 | £37,500 | 1.15 | 3 |

**Step 1**: Calculate PI for each project
- Project A: PI = (£200,000 + £40,000) / £200,000 = 1.20
- Project B: PI = (£300,000 + £90,000) / £300,000 = 1.30
- Project C: PI = (£250,000 + £37,500) / £250,000 = 1.15

**Step 2**: Rank projects by PI (highest first)

**Step 3**: Allocate capital to highest PI projects until exhausted
- Select Project B (£300,000)
- Remaining budget: £200,000
- Select Project A (£200,000)
- Budget now fully allocated

**Result**: Projects B and A should be funded, creating a total NPV of £130,000

### Mathematical Programming Approach

For complex situations with multiple constraints, linear programming can be used:

**Objective function:**
```
Maximise ∑(NPV_j × X_j)
```

**Subject to constraints:**
```
∑(Investment_j × X_j) ≤ Capital Budget
X_j ∈ {0,1} or 0 ≤ X_j ≤ 1 (depending on divisibility)
```

Where:
- X_j represents the proportion of project j undertaken
- j ranges from 1 to the number of available projects

**This approach is useful when:**
- Projects can be partially funded
- Multiple constraints exist (not just capital)
- Projects are interdependent

**Example**: A company might face constraints on:
- Total capital available
- Risk exposure per sector
- Human resources available
- Manufacturing capacity

Linear programming finds the optimal allocation across all constraints.

## Incorporating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Factors

Modern investment appraisal increasingly considers ESG impacts alongside financial returns.

### ESG Framework

```
ESG-Integrated Investment Appraisal
├── Environmental Factors
│   ├── Carbon Pricing
│   └── Resource Efficiency
├── Social Factors
│   ├── Community Impact
│   └── Human Capital
└── Governance Factors
    ├── Risk Management
    └── Stakeholder Alignment
```

### Why ESG Matters in Investment Decisions

**Traditional view**: Maximise shareholder value regardless of externalities

**Modern view**: Long-term value creation requires considering all stakeholders
- Environmental impacts eventually create financial consequences
- Social license to operate affects business sustainability
- Governance quality impacts execution and risk management

### Quantification Methods

| ESG Factor | Quantification Approach | Financial Integration | Example |
|------------|-------------------------|----------------------|---------|
| Carbon emissions | Shadow carbon price | Additional cost per tonne CO₂e | Add £50/tonne CO₂e to operating costs |
| Water usage | True cost of water | Adjusted operating expenses | Value water at £2/m³ instead of actual price |
| Community benefits | Social return on investment (SROI) | External benefit valuation | Calculate £5 social value for every £1 invested |
| Human capital | Productivity differentials | Adjusted revenue/cost projections | Model 5% higher productivity for better working conditions |
| Governance quality | Risk premium adjustment | Modified discount rate | Add 1% to discount rate for poor governance |

### The Shadow Price Concept Explained

Many ESG factors don't have market prices but do have real value or cost.

**Shadow price**: The estimated true economic value of something not fully reflected in market prices

**Example: Carbon emissions**
- Market price might be £0 (no carbon tax)
- But emissions create real economic costs through climate change
- Shadow price of £50/tonne attempts to capture this true cost
- Adding this to financial projections creates more accurate valuation

### Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis

When ESG factors are difficult to monetise, a weighted scoring approach can be used:

```
Project Score = ∑(w_i × Factor Score_i)
```

Where:
- w_i represents the weight assigned to factor i
- Factor Score_i is the performance score for factor i

**The process:**
1. Identify all relevant decision factors
2. Assign weights to each factor based on importance
3. Score each project on each factor (e.g., 1-10 scale)
4. Calculate weighted score
5. Rank projects by total score

### Case Example: Renewable Energy Investment

| Factor | Weight | Project A | Project B | Project C |
|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| NPV (£m) | 40% | 12.5 (8/10) | 15.2 (10/10) | 10.8 (7/10) |
| IRR (%) | 20% | 14.5 (8/10) | 16.8 (10/10) | 13.2 (7/10) |
| Carbon Reduction (kt CO₂e) | 20% | 80 (8/10) | 60 (6/10) | 95 (10/10) |
| Jobs Created | 10% | 45 (8/10) | 30 (5/10) | 60 (10/10) |
| Community Index | 10% | High (8/10) | Medium (6/10) | Very High (10/10) |
| **Weighted Score** | 100% | **8.0** | **8.1** | **8.0** |

**Analysis:**
- Project B has the highest financial returns
- Project C has the highest ESG benefits
- With this weighting scheme, Project B ranks marginally highest overall
- Changing weights to emphasize ESG would favor Project C

## Advanced Risk Analysis Techniques

Beyond sensitivity analysis, several sophisticated approaches help quantify investment risk.

### Risk Analysis Spectrum

```
Simple ───────────────────────────────────────────────► Complex
  │                │               │               │
Sensitivity      Scenario       Decision        Monte Carlo
Analysis        Analysis        Trees         Simulation
```

### Understanding Monte Carlo Simulation

**Traditional risk analysis** uses a few discrete scenarios (e.g., best, most likely, worst case)

**Monte Carlo simulation** creates thousands of scenarios by:
1. Identifying key variables (e.g., price, volume, costs)
2. Defining probability distributions for each variable
3. Randomly sampling from these distributions
4. Calculating outcomes for each combination
5. Building a probability distribution of results

**The process visualized:**

```
Input Distributions                          Output Distribution
                                                     
Revenue                                          NPV
│▄▄▄▄│                                            │     ▄▄▄
│▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄│                Monte Carlo            │  ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄
│▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄│  ──────────Simulation───────────► │▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄
                                                 │▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄

Costs                                        Probability of 
│     ▄▄▄▄│                                  negative NPV = 12%
│  ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄│                                       │
│▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄│                                     ▼
                                            ───────0────────►
```

**Key outputs include:**
- Expected NPV (average across all scenarios)
- Probability of negative NPV (risk of loss)
- 90% confidence interval (range of likely outcomes)
- Key variables driving uncertainty (sensitivity)

### Decision Tree Analysis

Decision trees incorporate sequential decisions and uncertain outcomes:

```
                                  High Growth (60%)
                                 /  NPV = £8.2m
                   Expand (?)   /
                  /            /   Moderate Growth (40%)
Initial         /              \   NPV = £5.1m
Investment ────┤               
£4.5m          \                  Stable Growth (70%)
                \                /  NPV = £3.6m
                  Don't Expand  /
                     (?)        \  Slow Growth (30%)
                                 \  NPV = £2.8m
```

**How to analyze a decision tree:**
1. Work backward from right to left
2. Calculate expected value at each chance node (probability-weighted average)
3. Choose highest expected value at each decision node

**Decision tree analysis in the example:**
- Expected value if expand: (0.6 × £8.2m) + (0.4 × £5.1m) = £6.98m
- Expected value if don't expand: (0.7 × £3.6m) + (0.3 × £2.8m) = £3.36m
- Decision: Expand (£6.98m > £3.36m)

### Value at Risk (VaR)

Value at Risk answers: "What is the maximum loss we might experience with a given probability?"

For a confidence level α, VaR represents the maximum loss within the α-confidence interval:

| Confidence | VaR Amount | Interpretation |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| 90% | £220,000 | 10% chance of losing more than £220,000 |
| 95% | £285,000 | 5% chance of losing more than £285,000 |
| 99% | £390,000 | 1% chance of losing more than £390,000 |

**Visualizing VaR:**

## Post-Implementation Review Framework

Systematic evaluation of completed projects improves future investment decisions.

### Review Process

```
Post-Implementation Review
├── Financial Performance
│   ├── Cash Flow Analysis
│   └── NPV/IRR Assessment
├── Operational Performance
│   ├── Timeline Achievement
│   └── Quality Targets
├── Strategic Alignment
│   └── Strategic Objectives
└── Process Review
    └── Decision Process Evaluation
        └── Variance Analysis
            └── Knowledge Capture
                └── Future Investment Improvement
```

### Why Post-Implementation Reviews Matter

**Without reviews:**
- Same mistakes repeated
- Systematic biases go uncorrected
- No accountability for projections
- Limited organizational learning

**With reviews:**
- Improved forecasting accuracy
- Better understanding of risk factors
- Enhanced decision-making process
- Continuous improvement culture

### Review Template

| Area | Metric | Target | Actual | Variance |
|------|--------|--------|--------|----------|
| Financial | Cash Flow | £3.5m cumulative | £3.1m cumulative | -11.4% |
| Financial | NPV | £1.2m | £0.9m | -25.0% |
| Operational | Timeline | 24 months | 28 months | +16.7% |
| Operational | Quality | 99.5% spec compliance | 99.2% spec compliance | -0.3% |
| Strategic | Strategic Fit | Support growth strategy | Partially aligned | Partial |
| Process | Decision Quality | Robust analysis | Data gaps identified | Moderate |

### Lessons Learned Categories

Common areas for improvement identified in post-implementation reviews:

1. **Estimation accuracy**: Systemic biases in forecasting
   - Example: Sales projections consistently 15% too optimistic

2. **Risk identification**: Unforeseen risks or improper quantification
   - Example: Currency risk ignored in international project

3. **Stakeholder management**: Communication and alignment challenges
   - Example: Key user department not consulted during planning

4. **Resource allocation**: Availability and capability gaps
   - Example: Skilled technical staff unavailable when needed

5. **External changes**: Market shifts or regulatory developments
   - Example: New competitor entry not anticipated

### Implementation Framework

A structured implementation review provides insights for future investments:

| Phase | Key Questions | Common Findings |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| Pre-approval | Was the business case realistic and comprehensive? | Optimism bias in projections |
| Implementation | Were resources adequate and efficiently deployed? | Scope creep and timeline extensions |
| Operation | Did the investment achieve its intended outcomes? | Lower-than-expected utilisation |
| Closure | Was knowledge properly captured and disseminated? | Insufficient documentation of lessons |

## Key Takeaways

- Investment decisions are among the most consequential in financial management, committing substantial resources for extended periods with uncertain returns

- Cash flows, not accounting profits, are the basis for sound investment appraisal because they represent actual monetary value movements

- NPV is the most theoretically sound method, directly linked to shareholder value by calculating the present value of all future cash flows

- Multiple appraisal methods should be used in combination for a complete perspective, as each provides different insights into the investment opportunity

- Risk assessment is an essential component of investment decision-making, helping to quantify uncertainties and test the robustness of projections

- The broader organizational and strategic context must be considered alongside financial analysis, as investments must support overall business objectives

- Real options analysis captures the value of managerial flexibility in uncertain environments, recognizing that decisions can be adjusted as new information emerges

- ESG factors increasingly influence investment decisions and require systematic integration to ensure long-term value creation

- Post-implementation reviews are essential for organizational learning and improved decision-making, closing the feedback loop for continuous improvement

## Practice Exercises

To consolidate your understanding, attempt these practice problems before tomorrow's session:

1. A project requires an initial investment of £200,000 and is expected to generate annual cash flows of £50,000 for 5 years. Calculate the project's payback period, NPV (using a 12% discount rate), and IRR.

2. Company A is considering two mutually exclusive projects with the following cash flows:

| Year | Project X (£) | Project Y (£) |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| 0    | -300,000     | -300,000     |
| 1    | 100,000      | 250,000      |
| 2    | 150,000      | 100,000      |
| 3    | 150,000      | 50,000       |
| 4    | 50,000       | 25,000       |

Using a discount rate of 10%, calculate:
   - The NPV of each project
   - The IRR of each project
   - The payback period of each project
   - Which project should be selected and why?

3. How would your recommendation for question 2 change if:
   - The company's cost of capital increased to 15%?
   - The company faced capital rationing and could only invest £200,000?
   - Project Y's Year 1 cash flow was uncertain and could vary by ±20%?
