    "text": "This afternoon, we build upon the financial framework and ratio analysis covered this morning to focus on one of the most critical aspects of financial management: capital investment decisions.\n\nLearning Outcomes for This Session By the end of this afternoon, you will be able to:\n\nExplain the nature and importance of investment decision-making\nIdentify and evaluate the five main investment appraisal methods found in practice\nUse these methods to reach decisions on investment opportunities\nExplain the key stages in the investment decision-making process\nApply techniques to handle risk in investment decisions\n\n\n\n\nInvestment decisions represent long-term commitments of substantial resources with uncertain returns. They are among the most consequential decisions finance managers must make.\n\n\nCapital investment decisions typically involve:\n\nSubstantial resource allocation\nExtended time horizons\nLimited reversibility once undertaken\nStrategic implications for the organisation’s future direction\nMultiple risk dimensions\n\n\n\n\n                        Identify investment opportunity\n                                      ↓\n                        Gather relevant information\n                                      ↓\n                       Evaluate using appraisal techniques\n                                      ↓\n                          Consider risk factors\n                                      ↓\n                          Make investment decision\n                                      ↓\n                          Implement and monitor\n                                      ↓\n                        Post-implementation review\n\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry provides a classic example of the capital investment decision challenge:\n\nInitial R&D investment: £500m+ (significant upfront capital)\nDevelopment timeline: 10-15 years (extended time commitment)\nSuccess rate: Only 1 in 10 compounds receives regulatory approval (substantial uncertainty)\nStrategic importance: Defines company product pipeline for decades\nMarket conditions: Subject to change during the development period\n\n\n\n\n\nA fundamental principle in capital investment appraisal is the focus on cash flows rather than accounting profits.\n\n\nCash flow definition\nA cash flow represents the actual movement of money into or out of a business. It represents tangible and objective monetary transactions.\nAccounting profit definition\nAccounting profit is a calculated figure based on matching revenues with expenses according to accounting principles. It includes non-cash items like depreciation.\nKey Equation:\nCash Flow = Profit + Depreciation + Other non-cash adjustments\nComponent explanation: - Begin with the accounting profit figure - Add back depreciation (which was subtracted to calculate profit but didn’t involve actual cash outflow) - Add/subtract other non-cash items (like provisions or unrealized gains/losses)\nPractical example: Consider a delivery van purchased for a business at £30,000. In accounting terms, this might be depreciated at £6,000 annually for 5 years. However, in cash flow terms, the entire £30,000 outflow occurs at purchase. In subsequent years, the accounting profit shows the £6,000 depreciation expense, but the cash flow doesn’t reflect this—the cash outflow has already occurred.\n\n\n\n\nObjectivity: Cash represents a measurable, tangible asset\nAccounting variability: Profits can differ based on accounting methods selected\nTiming implications: When cash flows occur directly impacts their value\nOperational impact: Investment decisions directly affect cash balances, influencing an organization’s operational capabilities\n\n\n\n\n\nIncremental: Cash flows arising directly because of the project\nFuture-oriented: Past or “sunk” costs are irrelevant\nAfter-tax: Tax implications affect the actual cash benefit\n\n\n\n\n\nSunk costs: Previously committed expenditures that cannot be recovered\nNon-incremental overhead allocations: Fixed costs that would exist regardless of the new project\nInterest payments: These are captured in the discount rate used in evaluation\nAccounting conventions: Such as depreciation, which don’t represent actual cash movements\n\n\nCommon Error to Avoid\nIncluding already committed (sunk) costs in investment appraisal calculations. Once spent, these costs are irrelevant to the decision to proceed.\nExample: If £50,000 has been spent on market research for a potential product, that £50,000 should not be included when deciding whether to launch the product. That expenditure is unrecoverable regardless of the decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider how an accounting statement differs from the cash flow perspective:\nTypical Income Statement\n\n\n\nItem\n£000\n£000\n\n\n\n\nCredit sales revenue\n1,200\n\n\n\nLess Cost of sales:\n\n\n\n\nOpening inventories\n100\n\n\n\nAdd Purchases\n750\n\n\n\nLess Closing inventories\n(120)\n730\n\n\nGross profit\n\n470\n\n\nLess:\n\n\n\n\nCredit card discounts\n60\n\n\n\nRent and rates\n180\n\n\n\nOther costs\n240\n\n\n\nDepreciation of fittings\n140\n620\n\n\nProfit for the period\n\n(150)\n\n\n\nConverting to Cash Flow:\n\nThe income statement shows a loss of £150,000\nHowever, depreciation (£140,000) doesn’t represent actual cash leaving the business\nThe inventory increase (£20,000) represents cash spent but not yet expensed\nCredit sales (£1,200,000) may not all have been received in cash yet\n\nTo convert to cash flow: - Start with the profit figure: -£150,000 - Add back non-cash expenses (depreciation): +£140,000 - Adjust for working capital changes (e.g., inventory increase): -£20,000 - Adjust for credit sales not yet received in cash: varies\nThe resulting figure represents the actual cash movement during the period, which may be significantly different from the accounting profit.\n\n\n\nBefore exploring investment appraisal methods, it’s useful to clarify some key terminology:\n\nCapital investment: The allocation of funds to long-term assets or projects expected to generate value over multiple years\nCash flow: The actual movement of money into or out of a business\nDiscount rate: The rate used to convert future cash flows to present value, reflecting the time value of money and risk\nPresent value: The current worth of a future cash flow, adjusted for the time value of money\nTime value of money: The concept that money available now is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential to earn returns\nIncremental cash flow: Additional cash flow occurring as a direct result of a decision\nSunk cost: A cost already incurred that cannot be recovered\nOpportunity cost: The value of the next best alternative foregone when making a decision\nTerminal value: The estimated value of an asset or project at the end of a specific period\nRisk premium: The additional return expected for accepting additional risk\n\n\n\n\nFive main methods are used in practice to evaluate investment projects:\n\n\nInvestment Appraisal Methods\n    ├── Discounted Cash Flow Methods\n    │   ├── Net Present Value (NPV)\n    │   ├── Internal Rate of Return (IRR)\n    │   └── Discounted Payback Period\n    │\n    ├── Non-Discounted Cash Flow Methods\n    │   └── Payback Period\n    │\n    └── Accounting Profit-Based\n        └── Accounting Rate of Return\n\n\n\nBefore exploring discounted cash flow methods, it’s essential to understand the time value of money.\nThe principle: £100 today is worth more than £100 received in one year’s time.\nReasons: 1. Opportunity Cost: Present funds can be invested to generate returns 2. Inflation: The purchasing power of money typically decreases over time 3. Uncertainty: Future cash receipts carry inherent uncertainty\nExample: If funds can be invested at 5% annual interest, then: - £100 today would grow to £105 in one year (£100 × 1.05) - Therefore, £105 received one year from now is equivalent to having £100 today - The “present value” of £105 received in one year is £100\nThis is calculated as: £105 ÷ 1.05 = £100\nExtension of this concept: - £100 today would grow to £110.25 in two years (£100 × 1.05 × 1.05) - Therefore, £110.25 received two years from now is equivalent to having £100 today - The present value of £110.25 received in two years is £100\nThis is calculated as: £110.25 ÷ (1.05)² = £110.25 ÷ 1.1025 = £100\nDCF methods explicitly account for this through discounting.\n\n\n\n[Graph showing trends in investment appraisal method usage over time]\nThe graph would show that over the past two decades: - Net Present Value (NPV) usage has been steadily increasing - Internal Rate of Return (IRR) usage has been growing even faster - Payback Period (PP) usage has been gradually declining - Accounting Rate of Return (ARR) usage has been declining more rapidly\n\n\n\n\nThe Payback Period is the time required to recover the initial investment from project cash flows.\n\n\nThe Payback Period tells us the duration required for cumulative cash inflows to equal the initial investment.\nFormula:\nPayback Period = Time until ∑ Cash Flows = 0\nIn methodological terms: Calculate the cumulative cash flows (starting with the negative initial investment) until the total becomes positive. The point at which this occurs is the payback period.\nDecision Rule: - Accept projects with PP &lt; maximum acceptable period - Between competing projects, prefer shorter payback - The “maximum acceptable period” is typically established by organizational policy\n\n\n\nA project costs £500,000 with the following expected cash flows:\n\n\n\nYear\nCash Flow (£)\nCumulative Cash Flow (£)\n\n\n\n\n0\n-500,000\n-500,000\n\n\n1\n150,000\n-350,000\n\n\n2\n180,000\n-170,000\n\n\n3\n200,000\n30,000\n\n\n4\n120,000\n150,000\n\n\n5\n100,000\n250,000\n\n\n\nStep 1: Begin with the initial investment as a negative cash flow (Year 0)\nStep 2: Add each year’s cash flow to calculate a running total\nStep 3: Determine when the cumulative total becomes positive (between Years 2 and 3)\nStep 4: Calculate the precise payback period: - At the end of Year 2, £170,000 remains to be recovered - Year 3 generates £200,000 - The proportion of Year 3 needed is: £170,000 ÷ £200,000 = 0.85 - Therefore, Payback Period = 2 + 0.85 = 2.85 years\nVisual Representation:\nCumulative Cash Flow\n£250,000 |                                    /\n£150,000 |                           /------/\n £30,000 |                  /-------/\n        0|----------------/-----------------\n-£170,000|         /-----/\n-£350,000|  /-----/\n-£500,000|--/----------------------------------\n           0      1      2      3      4      5\n                              ↑\n                         Payback Point (2.85 years)\n\n\n\nAdvantages: - Computational simplicity - Focus on liquidity and capital recovery - Basic risk indicator - Practical application frequency\nLimitations: - Disregards cash flows beyond the payback period - Neglects time value of money - Fails to consider investment scale - Often employs arbitrary thresholds - Not aligned with shareholder wealth maximization\n\n\n\n\nThe Discounted Payback Period addresses a key limitation of the standard payback by considering the time value of money.\n\n\nThe Discounted Payback Period indicates the duration required for cumulative discounted cash inflows to equal the initial investment.\nFormula:\nDiscounted Payback Period = Time until ∑ [Cash Flow_t / (1+r)^t] = 0\nWhere: - t = time period (typically years) - r = discount rate - The notation (1+r)^t means (1+r) raised to the power of t\nMethodological process: 1. Convert all future cash flows to their present value (by discounting with factor (1+r)^t) 2. Calculate the cumulative discounted cash flows (starting with the initial investment) 3. The point at which the cumulative total becomes positive is the discounted payback period\nDecision Rule: - Accept projects with DPP &lt; maximum acceptable period - Between competing projects, prefer shorter discounted payback\n\n\n\nBefore proceeding to the example, it’s important to understand the discounting calculation:\nDiscount factor: The multiplier applied to future cash flows to determine present value\nFor a discount rate of 10%: - Year 1 discount factor: 1 ÷ (1+0.10)¹ = 1 ÷ 1.10 = 0.909 - Year 2 discount factor: 1 ÷ (1+0.10)² = 1 ÷ 1.21 = 0.826 - Year 3 discount factor: 1 ÷ (1+0.10)³ = 1 ÷ 1.331 = 0.751 - And so on…\nGraphical representation of discount factors over time:\n1.000 |*\n0.909 | *\n0.826 |  *\n0.751 |   *\n0.683 |    *\n0.621 |     *\n      +------\n      0 1 2 3 4 5\n         Years\nThe discount factor decreases as time extends further into the future, reflecting the diminishing present value of future cash flows.\n\n\n\nUsing the same project with a 10% discount rate:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nCash Flow (£)\nDiscount Factor\nDiscounted CF (£)\nCumulative DCF (£)\n\n\n\n\n0\n-500,000\n1.000\n-500,000\n-500,000\n\n\n1\n150,000\n0.909\n136,350\n-363,650\n\n\n2\n180,000\n0.826\n148,680\n-214,970\n\n\n3\n200,000\n0.751\n150,200\n-64,770\n\n\n4\n120,000\n0.683\n81,960\n17,190\n\n\n5\n100,000\n0.621\n62,100\n79,290\n\n\n\nStep 1: Calculate the discount factor for each year using the formula 1/(1+r)^t - Year 1: 1/(1.10)¹ = 0.909 - Year 2: 1/(1.10)² = 0.826 - And so on…\nStep 2: Calculate the discounted cash flow by multiplying each cash flow by its discount factor - Year 0: -£500,000 × 1.000 = -£500,000 - Year 1: £150,000 × 0.909 = £136,350 - And so on…\nStep 3: Calculate the cumulative discounted cash flow - Year 0: -£500,000 - Year 1: -£500,000 + £136,350 = -£363,650 - And so on…\nStep 4: Determine when the cumulative total becomes positive (between Years 3 and 4)\nStep 5: Calculate the precise discounted payback period: - At the end of Year 3, £64,770 remains to be recovered - Year 4 generates a discounted cash flow of £81,960 - The proportion of Year 4 required is: £64,770 ÷ £81,960 = 0.79 - Therefore, Discounted Payback Period = 3 + 0.79 = 3.79 years\nNote: The calculation in the original table showed 3.20 years, but our worked example shows 3.79 years. For teaching purposes, we’ll use our calculated value of 3.79 years.\n\n\n\nAdvantages: - Incorporates time value of money: Unlike standard PP - Maintains interpretative simplicity: Still provides a clear metric for capital recovery - More accurate measure of recovery period: Based on the actual value of money over time\nLimitations: - Still disregards cash flows after the payback period: May miss substantial future returns - Arbitrary threshold selection: The “acceptable” discounted payback period often lacks objective basis - Not directly linked to shareholder wealth maximization: Doesn’t necessarily indicate value creation\n\n\n\nCumulative Cash Flow\n£250,000 |                                    /\n         |                           /------/\n         |                  /-------/\n       0 |----------------/-----------------\n         |         /-----/\n         |  /-----/\n-£500,000|--/----------------------------------\n           0      1      2      3      4      5\n                  ↑                ↑\n               Payback         Discounted\n              (2.85 years)       Payback\n                              (3.79 years)\nThe discounted payback period exceeds the regular payback period. This relationship is consistently true because discounting reduces the present value of future cash flows.\n\n\n\n\nThe Net Present Value method is the most theoretically sound approach to investment appraisal, directly linking to shareholder wealth maximization.\n\n\nNet Present Value represents the sum of all project cash flows, discounted to present value.\nFormula:\nNPV = ∑ [Cash Flow_t / (1+r)^t]\nWhere: - t = time period (typically years) - r = discount rate (cost of capital) - ∑ symbol means “sum of all terms”\nMethodological process: 1. Convert all cash flows to present value using the appropriate discount rate 2. Sum all discounted cash flows (including the initial investment) 3. The resulting figure represents the net value created by the project in present terms\nDecision Rule: - Accept projects with NPV &gt; 0 (project creates value) - Reject projects with NPV &lt; 0 (project destroys value) - Between competing projects, prefer higher NPV\n\n\n\nThe discount rate used in NPV calculations is crucial and reflects several components:\nDiscount rate components:\n- Risk-free rate (time value of money)\n- Inflation premium\n- Risk premium\nRisk-free rate: The return available on risk-free investments (typically government securities)\nInflation premium: Adjustment for expected decrease in purchasing power\nRisk premium: Additional return required to compensate for project-specific risk\nExample: - Risk-free rate: 2% - Expected inflation: 3% - Project risk premium: 5% - Resulting discount rate: 2% + 3% + 5% = 10%\nThe discount rate effectively establishes the minimum acceptable return for the project.\n\n\n\nUsing our same project with a 10% discount rate:\n\n\n\nYear\nCash Flow (£)\nDiscount Factor\nDiscounted CF (£)\n\n\n\n\n0\n-500,000\n1.000\n-500,000\n\n\n1\n150,000\n0.909\n136,350\n\n\n2\n180,000\n0.826\n148,680\n\n\n3\n200,000\n0.751\n150,200\n\n\n4\n120,000\n0.683\n81,960\n\n\n5\n100,000\n0.621\n62,100\n\n\n\nStep 1: Calculate the discount factor for each year using the formula 1/(1+r)^t - Year 0: 1/(1.10)⁰ = 1.000 (no discounting for present money) - Year 1: 1/(1.10)¹ = 0.909 - Year 2: 1/(1.10)² = 0.826 - And so on…\nStep 2: Calculate the discounted cash flow by multiplying each cash flow by its discount factor - Year 0: -£500,000 × 1.000 = -£500,000 - Year 1: £150,000 × 0.909 = £136,350 - And so on…\nStep 3: Sum all the discounted cash flows to derive the NPV - NPV = -£500,000 + £136,350 + £148,680 + £150,200 + £81,960 + £62,100 = £79,290\nSince the NPV is positive (£79,290), the project creates value and should be accepted.\n\n\n\nNPV interpretation: - If NPV = £79,290, the project generates £79,290 more value in present terms than an alternative investment at the discount rate - It represents the additional value created beyond the required return\nAlternative perspective: - If presented with two options: - Deposit £500,000 in an investment yielding 10% annually, or - Invest £500,000 in this project - The positive NPV of £79,290 indicates the project delivers greater value than the alternative investment\n\n\n\nAdvantages: - Considers all cash flows over project life: No arbitrary cutoff point - Incorporates time value of money: Appropriately values future cash flows - Directly linked to shareholder wealth maximization: Positive NPV indicates increased shareholder value - Allows for risk adjustment via discount rate: Higher-risk projects can be evaluated with higher discount rates - Additive across projects: NPVs of multiple projects can be aggregated\nLimitations: - Greater computational complexity: Requires understanding of discounting methods - Sensitivity to discount rate selection: Minor changes in discount rate can significantly impact NPV - Assumes reinvestment at the discount rate: May not always reflect reality - Provides absolute rather than relative measure: Doesn’t indicate capital efficiency\n\n\n\n\nThe Internal Rate of Return is the discount rate at which a project’s NPV equals zero, representing the project’s “yield.”\n\n\nThe Internal Rate of Return represents the discount rate that equates the present value of cash inflows with the present value of cash outflows.\nFormula: IRR is the value of r that satisfies:\n∑ [Cash Flow_t / (1+r)^t] = 0\nMethodological process: 1. Determine the discount rate at which NPV equals exactly zero 2. This rate represents the project’s effective return rate 3. At this exact rate, the investment would be financially neutral\nDecision Rule: - Accept projects with IRR &gt; cost of capital - Reject projects with IRR &lt; cost of capital - Between competing projects, prefer higher IRR\n\n\n\nIRR interpretation: - Represents the project’s internal efficiency or yield - Comparable to an effective interest rate on the investment - If IRR exceeds the cost of capital, the project creates value\nMathematical solution: - Unlike NPV, no direct formula exists to calculate IRR - Requires iterative calculation or financial software - Solves for the discount rate that results in NPV = 0\n\n\n\nUsing the same project cash flows:\n\n\n\nYear\nCash Flow (£)\n\n\n\n\n0\n-500,000\n\n\n1\n150,000\n\n\n2\n180,000\n\n\n3\n200,000\n\n\n4\n120,000\n\n\n5\n100,000\n\n\n\nTo find the IRR, we need to determine the value of r where:\n-500,000 + 150,000/(1+r)¹ + 180,000/(1+r)² + 200,000/(1+r)³ + 120,000/(1+r)⁴ + 100,000/(1+r)⁵ = 0\nIterative Approach: 1. Begin with r = 15% - NPV = -£36,764 (negative) 2. Try r = 12% - NPV = £13,477 (positive) 3. Try r = 14% - NPV = -£16,025 (negative) 4. Try r = 13% - NPV = -£2,048 (negative) 5. Try r = 12.5% - NPV = £5,477 (positive) 6. Try r = 12.8% - NPV = £560 (positive) 7. Try r = 12.9% - NPV = -£1,088 (negative)\nThrough this iterative process, we can estimate that IRR ≈ 12.85%\nSince IRR (12.85%) &gt; Cost of capital (10%), the project is acceptable.\n\n\n\n    NPV\n  £100,000 |\n           |\n   £50,000 |       *\n           |    *      *\n        0 |-------------------*------------\n           |              *      *\n  -£50,000 |                       *\n           |\n -£100,000 |\n           +-------------------------------\n             0%   5%   10%  IRR  15%  20%\n                          (12.85%)\nThe graph illustrates NPV at different discount rates. The point where the line intersects the x-axis represents the IRR.\nKey insights from this graph: - At discount rates below IRR, NPV is positive - At discount rates above IRR, NPV is negative - At exactly IRR, NPV is zero\n\n\n\nAdvantages: - Percentage format aids interpretation: Managers often find percentage returns more intuitive than absolute values - Incorporates time value of money: Appropriately values future cash flows - Considers complete cash flow profile: Includes all project cash flows - Widespread professional application: Commonly used in business contexts\nLimitations: - Multiple IRRs possible with non-conventional cash flows: If cash flows change direction more than once - Scale of investment not considered: A smaller project might have a higher IRR but create less total value - Reinvestment assumption may be unrealistic: Assumes cash flows can be reinvested at the IRR - Potential ranking conflicts with NPV: May produce different project rankings than NPV - Indirect relationship to shareholder wealth maximization: A high IRR doesn’t necessarily maximize value\n\n\n\nConsider two mutually exclusive projects:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject\nInitial Investment\nCash Flow Year 1\nIRR\nNPV (at 10%)\n\n\n\n\nSmall\n-£10,000\n£13,000\n30%\n£1,818\n\n\nLarge\n-£100,000\n£115,000\n15%\n£4,545\n\n\n\nIRR Ranking: Small Project (30%) &gt; Large Project (15%) NPV Ranking: Large Project (£4,545) &gt; Small Project (£1,818)\nAnalysis: NPV provides the better guide to value creation. The large project creates more total wealth, even though its percentage return is lower.\n\n\n\n\nThe Accounting Rate of Return focuses on accounting profit rather than cash flows.\n\n\nThe Accounting Rate of Return tells us: “What is the average accounting return on the investment?”\nFormula:\nARR = (Average annual profit / Average investment) × 100%\nWhere: - Average annual profit = Total project profits ÷ Project life - Average investment = (Initial investment + Residual value) ÷ 2\nIn plain English: 1. Calculate the average annual accounting profit over the project’s life 2. Calculate the average investment over the project’s life 3. Divide the average profit by the average investment to get the return rate\nDecision Rule: - Accept projects with ARR &gt; minimum required return - Reject projects with ARR &lt; minimum required return - Between competing projects, prefer higher ARR\n\n\n\nUnlike NPV and IRR, ARR uses accounting profits, which: - Include non-cash items like depreciation - Follow accounting conventions that may vary between companies - Don’t consider the timing of cash flows\nThis makes it fundamentally different from discounted cash flow methods.\n\n\n\nA project requires an initial investment of £500,000 with the following profit projections:\n\n\n\nYear\nAccounting Profit (£)\n\n\n\n\n1\n90,000\n\n\n2\n110,000\n\n\n3\n130,000\n\n\n4\n80,000\n\n\n5\n70,000\n\n\n\nWith a residual value of £100,000.\nStep 1: Calculate the total and average annual profit - Total profit = £90,000 + £110,000 + £130,000 + £80,000 + £70,000 = £480,000 - Average annual profit = £480,000 ÷ 5 = £96,000\nStep 2: Calculate the average investment - Initial investment = £500,000 - Residual value = £100,000 - Average investment = (£500,000 + £100,000) ÷ 2 = £300,000\nStep 3: Calculate the ARR - ARR = (£96,000 ÷ £300,000) × 100% = 32%\nNote: The ARR of 32% cannot be directly compared with the IRR of 12.85% from our previous example, as they measure different things.\n\n\n\nAdvantages: - Uses familiar accounting concepts: No need to convert to cash flows - Simple to calculate: Basic arithmetic only - Addresses profitability directly: Based on accounting profit, which is familiar to managers - No discounting required: Avoids complexity of time value calculations\nLimitations: - Based on accounting profits, not cash flows: May not reflect actual cash generation - Ignores time value of money: Treats profits in Year 1 the same as profits in Year 5 - No objective benchmark for minimum ARR: What’s a “good” ARR is often arbitrary - Sensitive to accounting policies: Different depreciation methods can change the ARR - Multiple calculation methods exist: Different companies may calculate it differently\n\n\n\n\nLet’s use a very simple example to see how each method evaluates a project:\nProject X: Initial investment of £1,000 with the following cash flows: - Year 1: £500 - Year 2: £600 - Year 3: £400\nCost of capital (discount rate): 10%\n\n\nInitial investment: £1,000 - Year 1: £500 (Cumulative: £500) - Year 2: £600 (Cumulative: £1,100)\nPayback Period = 1 + (£1,000 - £500)/£600 = 1 + 0.83 = 1.83 years\n\n\n\nInitial investment: £1,000 - Year 1: £500 × 0.909 = £454.50 (Cumulative: £454.50) - Year 2: £600 × 0.826 = £495.60 (Cumulative: £950.10) - Year 3: £400 × 0.751 = £300.40 (Cumulative: £1,250.50)\nDiscounted Payback Period = 2 + (£1,000 - £950.10)/£300.40 = 2 + 0.17 = 2.17 years\n\n\n\nNPV = -£1,000 + £454.50 + £495.60 + £300.40 = £250.50\n\n\n\nFinding the discount rate where: -£1,000 + £500/(1+r)¹ + £600/(1+r)² + £400/(1+r)³ = 0\nUsing financial calculator: IRR = 22.1%\n\n\n\nAssuming straight-line depreciation over 3 years and zero residual value: - Annual depreciation = £1,000 ÷ 3 = £333.33 - Accounting profits: - Year 1: £500 - £333.33 = £166.67 - Year 2: £600 - £333.33 = £266.67 - Year 3: £400 - £333.33 = £66.67 - Average annual profit = (£166.67 + £266.67 + £66.67) ÷ 3 = £166.67 - Average investment = (£1,000 + £0) ÷ 2 = £500 - ARR = (£166.67 ÷ £500) × 100% = 33.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nResult\nDecision (assuming standard criteria)\n\n\n\n\nPP\n1.83 years\nAccept if PP &lt;

The positive NPV and high IRR are particularly encouraging indicators of value creation.\n\n\n\n\nInvestment decisions inherently involve risk and uncertainty.

Unlike financial options (which give the right to buy or sell financial assets), real options give managers the right to make business decisions.\nReal Options in Investment\n├── Option to Defer\n├── Option to Expand\n├── Option to Abandon\n├── Option to Contract\n└── Option to Switch\nReal options create value through managerial flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\n\n\nAnalogy: House Construction Project\nThink of real options like building a house in stages:\n\nOption to Defer: You buy land but wait to start construction until property prices rise\n\nYou’ve paid something (land cost) to create future flexibility\n\nOption to Expand: You build extra-deep foundations that would allow adding a second story later\n\nYou spend more now for the option to expand cheaply later\n\nOption to Abandon: You design the house so it could easily be sold as a commercial property\n\nYou’ve created an “exit strategy” if residential plans don’t work out\n\nOption to Contract: You design the house with a separate suite that could be rented out\n\nYou’ve created flexibility to scale back your personal space if needed\n\nOption to Switch: You install systems that allow the house to use either gas or electric heating\n\nYou’ve created flexibility to switch between energy sources based on prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption Type\nDescription\nValue Driver\nBusiness Example\n\n\n\n\nDefer\nAbility to postpone investment\nReduces uncertainty before committing\nOil company delaying field development until prices rise\n\n\nExpand\nOpportunity to increase scale\nCaptures upside potential\nE-commerce firm building oversized warehouse for future growth\n\n\nAbandon\nAbility to exit unprofitable projects\nLimits downside risk\nPharmaceutical company stopping drug development after poor trial results\n\n\nContract\nOption to reduce project scale\nMitigates losses in adverse conditions\nAirline reducing fleet size during travel downturns\n\n\nSwitch\nFlexibility to change inputs/outputs\nAdapts to changing market conditions\nManufacturing plant that can produce different products\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional NPV analysis often undervalues projects because it: - Assumes decisions are made now with no future flexibility - Doesn’t account for management’s ability to adapt to new information\nExample: Mining Project\nTraditional NPV analysis: - Initial investment: £50 million - Expected cash flows (present value): £45 million - NPV: -£5 million (would reject project)\nReal options analysis recognises: - Option to delay production if metal prices are low - Option to expand production if prices rise significantly - Option to abandon if costs exceed projections\nAfter accounting for these options, the project might have a positive value despite negative traditional NPV.\n\n\n\nReal options can be valued using:\n\nBlack-Scholes Model: Originally developed for financial options, can be adapted for simple real options\n\nWorks best when there’s a clear exercise date and price\n\nBinomial Lattice: Maps out possible future scenarios and decision points\n\nBetter for complex options with multiple decision points\n\nMonte Carlo Simulation: Uses thousands of random scenarios to estimate option value\n\nBest for highly uncertain situations with multiple variables\n\n\n\n\n\nA mining company considering a new site can view the investment as a series of options:\nStage 1: Exploration (Option to Defer) - Cost: £1 million for initial exploration - Creates option to develop if resources found - If no resources, lose £1 million - If resources found, move to Stage 2\nStage 2: Development (Option to Expand/Contract) - Cost: £20 million to develop the mine - Creates option to extract at different scales - Can choose small-scale (£10m) or large-scale (£20m) development\nStage 3: Extraction (Option to Switch/Abandon) - Can adjust extraction rate based on mineral prices - Can temporarily halt production if prices fall too low - Can sell the mine if prospects deteriorate permanently\nThis staged approach allows management to: 1.

    "text": "A fundamental principle in capital investment appraisal is the focus on cash flows rather than accounting profits.\n\n\nCash flow definition\nA cash flow represents the actual movement of money into or out of a business. It represents tangible and objective monetary transactions.\nAccounting profit definition\nAccounting profit is a calculated figure based on matching revenues with expenses according to accounting principles. It includes non-cash items like depreciation.\nKey Equation:\nCash Flow = Profit + Depreciation + Other non-cash adjustments\nComponent explanation: - Begin with the accounting profit figure - Add back depreciation (which was subtracted to calculate profit but didn’t involve actual cash outflow) - Add/subtract other non-cash items (like provisions or unrealized gains/losses)\nPractical example: Consider a delivery van purchased for a business at £30,000. In accounting terms, this might be depreciated at £6,000 annually for 5 years. However, in cash flow terms, the entire £30,000 outflow occurs at purchase. In subsequent years, the accounting profit shows the £6,000 depreciation expense, but the cash flow doesn’t reflect this—the cash outflow has already occurred.\n\n\n\n\nObjectivity: Cash represents a measurable, tangible asset\nAccounting variability: Profits can differ based on accounting methods selected\nTiming implications: When cash flows occur directly impacts their value\nOperational impact: Investment decisions directly affect cash balances, influencing an organization’s operational capabilities\n\n\n\n\n\nIncremental: Cash flows arising directly because of the project\nFuture-oriented: Past or “sunk” costs are irrelevant\nAfter-tax: Tax implications affect the actual cash benefit\n\n\n\n\n\nSunk costs: Previously committed expenditures that cannot be recovered\nNon-incremental overhead allocations: Fixed costs that would exist regardless of the new project\nInterest payments: These are captured in the discount rate used in evaluation\nAccounting conventions: Such as depreciation, which don’t represent actual cash movements\n\n\nCommon Error to Avoid\nIncluding already committed (sunk) costs in investment appraisal calculations. Once spent, these costs are irrelevant to the decision to proceed.\nExample: If £50,000 has been spent on market research for a potential product, that £50,000 should not be included when deciding whether to launch the product. That expenditure is unrecoverable regardless of the decision."

Opportunity Cost: Present funds can be invested to generate returns 2. Inflation: The purchasing power of money typically decreases over time 3. Uncertainty: Future cash receipts carry inherent uncertainty\nExample: If funds can be invested at 5% annual interest, then: - £100 today would grow to £105 in one year (£100 × 1.05) - Therefore, £105 received one year from now is equivalent to having £100 today - The “present value” of £105 received in one year is £100\nThis is calculated as: £105 ÷ 1.05 = £100\nExtension of this concept: - £100 today would grow to £110.25 in two years (£100 × 1.05 × 1.05) - Therefore, £110.25 received two years from now is equivalent to having £100 today - The present value of £110.25 received in two years is £100\nThis is calculated as: £110.25 ÷ (1.05)² = £110.25 ÷ 1.1025 = £100\nDCF methods explicitly account for this through discounting.\n\n\n\n[Graph showing trends in investment appraisal method usage over time]\nThe graph would show that over the past two decades: - Net Present Value (NPV) usage has been steadily increasing - Internal Rate of Return (IRR) usage has been growing even faster - Payback Period (PP) usage has been gradually declining - Accounting Rate of Return (ARR) usage has been declining more rapidly"

    "title": "Cost of Capital",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Every investment undertaken by a company requires financing that is either sourced by debt or equity. Each source has a cost.\nThe cost of capital needs to be considered from two perspectives:\n\nInvestor Perspective: Cost of capital is the “opportunity cost” - the return that could be gained by investing funds in an alternative investment with similar risk characteristics.\nCompany Perspective: The “cost of capital” is the minimum return a company must provide to investors to ensure they continue to provide finance for investment and/or additional finance for future projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe return from a project should at least cover a company’s current cost of finance. Therefore, establishing the cost of capital is vital in the evaluation and selection of projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are four major forms of external long-term capital:\n\nOrdinary shares\nPreference shares\n\nLoan capital\nRedeemable debentures\n\nIn addition, an important form of internal long-term capital is retained earnings.\n\n\n\nThe cost of capital serves as the discount rate for investment appraisal and is calculated as the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), which combines:\n\nCost of debt\nCost of equity\n\nThe framework involves calculating each component separately:\n\nCost of DebtCost of Equity\n\n\nTwo main products of debt: - Bank loans - Redeemable debt\n\n\nTwo models to calculate the cost of equity (Ke): 1. Dividend growth model 2. Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity represents the owners’ investment in a company. This includes:\n\nIssued share capital (shown in financial statements)\nRetained earnings (often incorrectly viewed as a “free” source of finance)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRetained Earnings have an opportunity cost equal to the cost of equity (without issue costs). The market value of equity shares reflects the value placed on retained earnings by equity holders.\n\n\n\n\nA company’s equity should be valued as though it were being sourced from the markets today. This means:\n\nMarket price should not include premium to reflect a declared dividend payment\nPrice should be reduced to reflect the costs associated with issuing shares\n\nThe market value of equity (MV) is calculated as:\nMV = Share issue price × Number of shares currently in issue\nWhere ‘share issue price’ is the current long-run market price for each equity share (ex-dividend) less issue costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nEx-dividend vs Cum-dividend\n- Cum-dividend: Share price includes a premium for an upcoming dividend payment - Ex-dividend: Price after the dividend has been paid, without the dividend premium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1Example 2Example 3\n\n\nInvierno plc has two million issued equity shares. The current market price (cum dividend) is 240p per share. The accrued dividend is 22p per share.\nRequired: Calculate the market value of Invierno plc’s shares for WACC calculation.\nSolution:\nEx-div share price = £2.40 - £0.22 = £2.18\nMarket value = ex-div share price × number of shares = £2.18 × 2,000,000 = £4,360,000\n\n\nAlberta has 3 million shares in issue. The ordinary shares currently have a market value of £1.30 per share. Dividend of 5p per share has just been paid.\nSolution:\nMV = ex-div price × no of shares = 3,000,000 × £1.30 = £3,900,000\n\n\nBeta has 1 million shares in issue. The ordinary shares have a market value of £1.25 per share. Dividend of 3p per share was just announced and will be paid in a month.\nSolution:\nex-div price = £1.25 - £0.03 = £1.22\nMV = £1.22 × 1,000,000 = £1,220,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost of equity is generally calculated using one of two methods:\n\nDividend Models: Focus on the returns received by investors\nCapital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM): Focus on the returns required to compensate for risk, relative to other investments\n\n\n\nThis model is used to calculate the cost of preference shares which typically maintain a constant dividend.\n\\[K_e = \\frac{D_1}{P_0}\\]\nWhere: - P₀ is the market value of equity (ex-dividend) - D₁ is the annual dividend (assuming no growth in dividend payout) - Ke is the equity holders’ required return (company’s cost of equity)\n\n\n\nExample 1Example 2\n\n\nFebrero PLC pays an annual dividend of 16p per share. The preference shares are currently trading at 188p. An interim dividend of 8p is about to be paid.\nRequired: Calculate the cost of equity capital for Febrero PLC.\nSolution:\nAnnual dividend = £0.16\nEx-div = £1.88 - £0.08 = £1.80\nUsing dividend valuation model, Ke = £0.16/£1.80 = 8.89%\n\n\nHugo Plc pays an annual dividend of 24p per share. The shares are currently trading at £2.3 per share. Annual dividend has just been paid.\nSolution:\nAnnual div = £0.24\nEx-div price = £2.3\nKe = £0.24/£2.30 = 10.43%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a growth rate is estimated, this is factored into the dividend valuation model to provide a cost of equity that takes future dividend increases into consideration:\n\\[K_e = \\frac{D_1}{P_0} + g = \\frac{D_0(1+g)}{P_0} + g\\]\nWhere: - g is the growth rate - D₀ is the dividend that has just been paid - P₀ is the market value of equity (ex-dividend) - D₁ is the next expected dividend - Ke is the cost of equity capital\n\n\nThe formula for calculating historical dividend growth rate:\n\\[g = \\sqrt[y]{\\frac{D_{t0}}{D_{t0-y}}} - 1\\]\nWhere: - g is the growth rate - Dt0 is the dividend just paid - Dt0-y is the dividend paid “y” years ago\n\n\n\n\nExample 1Example 2Example 3\n\n\nJunio PLC had the following dividends over the past 5 years:\n\n\n\nYear\nDividends £\n\n\n\n\n2011\n195,000\n\n\n2012\n249,600\n\n\n2013\n267,800\n\n\n2014\n318,500\n\n\n2015\n341,055\n\n\n\nRequired: Calculate the growth in Junio PLC’s dividends.\nSolution: There are 5 years of dividends provided which means 4 years of dividend growth:\n341,055 = 195,000(1+g)⁴\n1.749 = (1+g)⁴\n(1.749)^0.25 = 1+g\ng = (1.749)^0.25 – 1 = 15%\n\n\nFebrero PLC pays an annual dividend of 16p per share. The shares are currently trading at 188p. The annual dividend has just been paid.\nRequired: Calculate the cost of equity capital for Febrero PLC. Assume a growth rate of 7%.\nSolution: Ex-div P₀ = £1.88\ng = 7%\nD₀ = £0.16\nD₁ = D₀(1+g) = £0.16 × 1.07 = £0.1712\nKe = (D₁/P₀) + g = (£0.1712/£1.88) + 7% = 9.11% + 7% = 16.11%\n\n\nWhiskey Plc just paid out a total of £300,000 as dividend. The shares are currently trading at £2.33 per share, and there are a total of 3 million shares. Assume there is a growth rate of 5%.\nSolution: P₀ = £2.33\nD₀ = £300,000/3,000,000 = £0.10 per share\nD₁ = D₀(1+g) = £0.10 × 1.05 = £0.105\nKe = (D₁/P₀) + g = (£0.105/2.33) + 5% = 4.5% + 5% = 9.5%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssumes dividends grow smoothly, but this may not reflect reality\nSome companies pay zero dividends and reinvest 100% of earnings\nAssumes dividends continue to grow at historic rates\nIgnores that shareholders also receive returns in the form of capital gains\nResults are very sensitive to values of g and P₀\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Capital Asset Pricing Model evaluates the risks associated with investing in a company relative to other capital market investments.\n\n\n\nUnsystematic (unique/business) risk: Specific to a company/industry (e.g., strike action, merger)\nSystematic (market) risk: Affects the whole market (e.g., inflation, interest rates, GDP movements)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPortfolio theory suggests that an investor can diversify away unsystematic risk by holding a well-diversified portfolio. The larger the number of differing types of shares held, the more likely that unsystematic risk will be reduced.\n\n\nIt is generally thought that holding eight to ten carefully chosen shares is sufficient to diversify away unsystematic risk.\n\n\n\nBeta (β) is a measure of the systematic risk of an individual equity share relative to the systematic risk experienced by the market.\n\nBeta = 1: Company has the same risk as the market average\nBeta &gt; 1: More risky than the market (e.g., β=2 means twice as risky)\nBeta &lt; 1: Less risky than the market\n\nA company’s beta is obtained by plotting the returns of the company against the returns of the market over time, creating a “securities market line.”\n\n\n\nThe CAPM captures the gradient of the securities market line:\n\\[r_j = r_f + \\beta(r_m - r_f)\\]\nWhere: - rj is the return expected from company j (same as Ke) - rf is the risk-free rate of return - β is the level of systematic risk - (rm – rf) is the market risk premium\n\n\n\nExample 1Example 2Example 3\n\n\nM plc has a beta factor of 1.2. The yield on government bonds is 3% and the return on the market is 8%.\nRequired: Calculate M plc’s equity cost of capital using CAPM.\nSolution: rf = 3%\nrm = 8%\nβ = 1.2\nrj = rf + β(rm - rf)\nrj = 3% + 1.2(8% - 3%)\nrj = 3% + 1.2(5%)\nrj = 3% + 6%\nrj = 9%\n\n\nL plc has a beta factor of 1.5. The risk-free yield is 5%, and the market premium is 8%.\nRequired: Calculate L plc’s Ke using CAPM.\nSolution: rf = 5%\nMarket premium = (rm - rf) = 8%\nβ = 1.5\nrj = rf + β(rm - rf)\nrj = 5% + 1.5(8%)\nrj = 5% + 12%\nrj = 17%\n\n\nN plc is considered to be twice as sensitive to market change. Government bonds currently have a 5% coupon rate, and the average market return is 15%.\nRequired: Calculate N plc’s Ke using CAPM.\nSolution: rf = 5%\nrm = 15%\nβ = 2 (twice as sensitive)\nrj = rf + β(rm - rf)\nrj = 5% + 2(15% - 5%)\nrj = 5% + 20%\nrj = 25%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAPM\nDividend Growth Model\n\n\n\n\nTakes into account risk\nDoes not explicitly account for risk\n\n\nAssumes no taxation or transaction costs\nIncorporates actual market prices\n\n\nAssumes investors can diversify away unsystematic risk\nRequires historical dividend data\n\n\nCan be applied to all listed companies\nCannot be used for companies without dividend history\n\n\nAssumes investors can borrow/lend at risk-free rate\nBased on actual dividend payments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two main types of debt financing:\n\nUntraded Debt: Bank loans\nTraded Debt: Redeemable bonds\n\n\n\nWhen long-term debt is untraded, such as a bank loan: - The market value equates to the book value - The cost of capital is the post-tax interest rate charged on that debt\n\\[K_{dt} = i(1-t)\\]\nWhere: - Kdt is the cost of debt after taxation - i is the interest rate - t is the taxation rate\n\n\nIf a company has a bank loan of £1m with an interest rate of 8% and corporate tax is 30%:\nKd = 8% × (1-30%) = 5.6%\nThe market value of this loan is £1m, same as the book value.\n\n\n\n\nTraded debt usually takes the form of bonds that can be traded on stock markets:\n\nIn the UK, bonds have a nominal value of £100\nThe most common type is a “plain vanilla bond” with a fixed annual interest rate\nTraders value bonds based on their coupon (interest) compared to returns from similar investments\nInterest payments on debt are tax-deductible\n\n\n\nThe market value of bonds should be the cash flows expected by a company on a new issue:\nQuoted market value – Ex-interest – Ex-issue costs\nRedeemable bonds are valued at the present value of: - Future stream of income (coupon) for a set period (annuity), plus - Final redemption payment\nBoth discounted at the required rate of return.\n\n\n\nABC PLC has £2,000,000 of 8% bonds due for redemption at par in 3 years.

The larger the number of differing types of shares held, the more likely that unsystematic risk will be reduced.\n\n\nIt is generally thought that holding eight to ten carefully chosen shares is sufficient to diversify away unsystematic risk.\n\n\n\nBeta (β) is a measure of the systematic risk of an individual equity share relative to the systematic risk experienced by the market.\n\nBeta = 1: Company has the same risk as the market average\nBeta &gt; 1: More risky than the market (e.g., β=2 means twice as risky)\nBeta &lt; 1: Less risky than the market\n\nA company’s beta is obtained by plotting the returns of the company against the returns of the market over time, creating a “securities market line.”\n\n\n\nThe CAPM captures the gradient of the securities market line:\n\\[r_j = r_f + \\beta(r_m - r_f)\\]\nWhere: - rj is the return expected from company j (same as Ke) - rf is the risk-free rate of return - β is the level of systematic risk - (rm – rf) is the market risk premium\n\n\n\nExample 1Example 2Example 3\n\n\nM plc has a beta factor of 1.2.

Using both the residual dividend theory and signalling theory, recommend and justify an appropriate dividend policy."
