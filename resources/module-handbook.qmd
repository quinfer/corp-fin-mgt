## Examination (50%)

- **Format**: 3-hour online take-home examination

- **Due Date**: 9th June 17:00 (on Blackboard) *(revised from 21st June 12:30)*
- **Coverage**: All module content excluding Working Capital Management *(revised scope)*

**Examination Format Explanation**:

The examination is designed as a 3-hour assessment, meaning the content and expectations are calibrated to what you could reasonably complete in a 3-hour supervised exam setting. However, to accommodate the needs of students from diverse academic backgrounds, particularly those who may require additional time with mathematical problems, the exam will be available as a take-home assessment from Friday morning until Sunday evening.

This extended window allows you to:

- Choose a convenient 3-hour block of time for focused work
- Take additional time if needed for calculations and review
- Consult course materials and resources (open-book format)
- Work in a comfortable environment conducive to your best performance

While you have the entire weekend to submit your work, the examination questions are designed to be completed within approximately 3 hours of focused effort. This approach balances academic rigour with flexibility, ensuring fair assessment for all students regardless of their prior financial or mathematical experience.

The examination will consist of:

- Section A: Compulsory question based on a case scenario (40 marks)
- Section B: Choice of 2 questions from 3, each worth 30 marks

**Additional Exam Support:**

- Comprehensive practice examples will be provided by 31st May
- Online revision session scheduled for 5th June, 14:00-16:00 (provisional timing)
- Additional office hours available from 1st-6th June (arrange by appointment)

## Assessment Timeline Rationale

The revised assessment timeline has been implemented to:

1. Allow sufficient time for students to develop and apply financial analysis skills, particularly given the intensive block delivery format
2. Provide appropriate spacing between major assessments to enable deeper engagement with the material
3. Support students from non-financial backgrounds in developing the necessary technical competencies
4. Maintain academic rigour while ensuring fair assessment opportunities

## Additional Learning Support

In recognition of the mathematically complex nature of some module content, the following additional learning supports have been implemented:

- Extended set of practice exercises and solutions (available on Blackboard)
- Step-by-step guides for key financial calculations
- Optional drop-in support sessions for mathematical concepts (dates TBC)
- Dedicated discussion board for technical queries

# Module Policies

## Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools Policy

### Philosophy: LLM Premiums ≠ Premium Thinking

This module recognizes that AI tools are increasingly part of the professional landscape. However, we operate under the fundamental principle that **paying for premium AI services does not generate premium thinking**. The goal is to develop your authentic analytical capabilities, not to outsource them.

### Appropriate Uses of AI Tools

#### ✅ **Encouraged Uses:**
- **Research assistance**: Finding relevant sources and academic materials
- **Technical clarification**: Understanding financial formulas or concepts
- **Writing mechanics**: Grammar checking and basic proofreading
- **Calculation verification**: Double-checking mathematical computations
- **Brainstorming**: Generating initial ideas for further development
- **Translation**: Converting financial concepts between languages

#### ⚠️ **Conditional Uses (Require Attribution):**
- **Explanation requests**: Asking AI to explain complex financial theories
- **Example generation**: Creating practice scenarios for learning
- **Structure suggestions**: Getting framework ideas for reports

*When using AI in these ways, you must clearly state: "AI assistance was used for [specific purpose]"*

### Prohibited Uses

#### ❌ **Strictly Forbidden:**
- **Content generation**: Having AI write substantial portions of your assignments
- **Analysis substitution**: Using AI to perform critical evaluation for you
- **Argument development**: Letting AI construct your academic arguments
- **Data interpretation**: Having AI analyze financial data on your behalf
- **Recommendation formulation**: Using AI to develop business recommendations

### The Premium AI Fallacy

#### **Common Misconceptions:**
- "ChatGPT Plus will write better assignments" ❌
- "Claude Pro understands corporate finance" ❌
- "Latest AI models = automatic academic success" ❌

#### **Reality Check:**
- **AI are verbosity maximizers**, optimized for volume, not insight
- **Premium subscriptions** buy processing power, not critical thinking
- **Latest models** are better at generating convincing-sounding content, making them more dangerous for academic work
- **Experienced markers** can readily identify AI-generated analysis

### Academic Integrity Standards

#### **What We Expect:**
1. **Your authentic voice** in all written work
2. **Your critical analysis** of financial concepts and cases
3. **Your synthesis** of course materials and external sources
4. **Your professional judgment** in making business recommendations

#### **Red Flags for Markers:**
- Sudden changes in writing style or sophistication
- Generic analysis lacking specific course content integration
- Verbose explanations without focused insight
- Perfect grammar with shallow reasoning
- Repetitive phrase patterns common to AI output

### Professional Development Rationale

The restrictions exist because:

1. **Employers value human judgment**: No organization wants managers who can't think critically without AI
2. **Professional responsibility**: Future roles require authentic decision-making capabilities
3. **Competitive advantage**: Your unique analytical skills differentiate you in the job market
4. **Ethical obligations**: Business leaders must make independent judgments on complex issues

### Practical Guidelines

#### **Before Using Any AI Tool, Ask:**
- "What am I trying to learn here?"
- "How will using AI help or hinder my understanding?"
- "Can I explain and defend the output as my own thinking?"
- "Am I using AI as a crutch or as a legitimate tool?"

#### **Best Practices:**
- Use AI for understanding, not for doing
- Always verify AI information against credible sources
- Develop your ideas first, then use AI for refinement
- Maintain a clear audit trail of your thinking process

### Declaration Requirements

For all assessments, include this statement:

*"I declare that this work represents my own critical thinking and analysis. Any AI assistance used was limited to [specify: grammar checking/concept clarification/calculation verification] and did not substitute for my own intellectual contribution."*

### Consequences of Violations

- **Minor violations**: Opportunity to resubmit with guidance
- **Substantial violations**: Academic misconduct proceedings
- **Severe violations**: Module failure and program review

### Support and Guidance

If you're unsure about appropriate AI use:
- Consult with the module coordinator before using AI tools
- Attend workshops on academic integrity and AI
- Use provided practice materials to develop skills independently

Remember: The goal is to develop **your** expertise in corporate financial management, not to become proficient at prompting AI tools.

## Late Submissions

Late submissions of the coursework will be penalized according to university policy:
- Up to 5 working days late: work marked, maximum score 40%
- More than 5 working days late: zero marks

## Academic Integrity

All work submitted must be your own. Plagiarism and academic misconduct will be treated seriously according to university regulations. Please familiarize yourself with the university's academic integrity policy.

## Extensions Policy (REVISED)

Extensions for the coursework submission may be granted in exceptional circumstances. Requests should be made in writing to the module coordinator at least 7 days before the submission deadline, accompanied by appropriate evidence.

Given the condensed nature of this module, we recognise that some students may require additional flexibility. Individual circumstances affecting your ability to complete the coursework by the deadline will be considered sympathetically. Please contact the module coordinator (and Course Director) as early as possible to discuss any concerns.
