## Day 2 Overview {.unnumbered}

Welcome to Day 2 of the Corporate Financial Management module. Today explores how organizations source and cost the capital needed to fund investment opportunities. The day is structured into two complementary sessions:

- **Morning Session: Sources of Finance** - Examines various financing options for both short-term and long-term needs ([Slides](../slides/day2-morning-slides.html))
- **Afternoon Session: Cost of Capital** - Explores methods to calculate financing costs and determine optimal capital structure ([Slides](../slides/day2-afternoon-slides.html))

## Morning Session Summary

The morning session explores the range of financing options available to organizations:

:::

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of the afternoon session, you will be able to:

2. Determine the cost of debt for different debt instruments
3. Compute a firm's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)

## Today's Integrated Learning

The day's sessions are designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how organizations fund investments:

- Morning focus: Exploring **what** sources of finance are available to fund investments
- Afternoon focus: Determining **how much** each source of finance costs

This integrated approach connects the investment decisions covered on Day 1 with the practical aspects of financing those investments.

## Key Takeaways

:::{.callout-tip}
## Day 2 Essential Concepts

1. **Sources of Finance**:
   - Organizations should match the type of finance to the term of the investment (matching principle)
   - A hierarchy of financing preferences typically exists: internal sources, then debt, then equity
   - Cost, control implications, and risk profiles differ significantly across financing sources

2. **Cost of Capital**:
   - Cost of capital represents both the minimum required return on investments and the opportunity cost for investors
   - The WACC provides a framework for investment appraisal by establishing a discount rate
   - Capital structure decisions can impact overall cost of capital
   - Theoretical frameworks suggest varying perspectives on optimal capital structure
:::

## Preparation for Next Session

Building on the investment and financing discussions of Days 1-2, future sessions will explore:

- Working capital management
- Dividend policy considerations
- Financial risk management
- International financial management

Please review the practice exercises at the end of both today's sessions and prepare any questions for discussion.
