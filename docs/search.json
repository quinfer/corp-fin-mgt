    "text": "Final Reflection: Models as Tools for Insight\n\n\n\n\n“All models are wrong, but some are useful.” — George Box\n\nThe cost of capital isn’t a single, precise number — it’s a framework for thinking critically about funding and risk. The models we’ve explored today are tools for reasoning under uncertainty, not formulas for absolute truth.\nKey Learning Philosophy:\n\nExperiment confidently: Use the Excel workbook to test assumptions and break things\nQuestion everything: Ask why growth rates should continue, whether betas are stable, if markets are truly efficient\nFocus on insight over precision: Understanding the relationships matters more than calculating to the fourth decimal place\nApply contextually: Every company, industry, and situation has unique factors that models can’t fully capture\n\nFor Non-Finance Professionals:\nYour role isn’t to become a financial modeller, but to understand these concepts well enough to: - Ask the right questions during due diligence - Evaluate the reasonableness of financial projections - Understand how financing decisions affect client interests - Communicate effectively with financial professionals and clients\nThe confidence to engage with these concepts — not perfect technical mastery — is what will serve you best in practice.\n\n\n\nMoving Forward:\nUse the interactive workbook not to get it right, but to develop intuition. Adjust inputs, break assumptions, reflect on results. That’s how better financial decisions — and better legal advice — are made.\n🚀 Next Step: Complete the workbook exercises before tomorrow’s session on dividend policy. Pay special attention to how dividend assumptions affect cost of equity calculations."

However, to accommodate the needs of students from diverse academic backgrounds, particularly those who may require additional time with mathematical problems, the exam will be available as a take-home assessment from Friday morning until Sunday evening.\nThis extended window allows you to:\n\nChoose a convenient 3-hour block of time for focused work\nTake additional time if needed for calculations and review\nConsult course materials and resources (open-book format)\nWork in a comfortable environment conducive to your best performance\n\nWhile you have the entire weekend to submit your work, the examination questions are designed to be completed within approximately 3 hours of focused effort. This approach balances academic rigour with flexibility, ensuring fair assessment for all students regardless of their prior financial or mathematical experience.\nThe examination will consist of:\n\nSection A: Compulsory question based on a case scenario (40 marks)\nSection B: Choice of 2 questions from 3, each worth 30 marks\n\nAdditional Exam Support:\n\nComprehensive practice examples will be provided by 31st May\nOnline revision session scheduled for 5th June, 14:00-16:00 (provisional timing)\nAdditional office hours available from 1st-6th June (arrange by appointment)"

The firm makes high quality garden tools which it sells in its domestic market but not abroad.\nOver the last few years, the share price has risen significantly as the firm has expanded organically within its domestic market. Unfortunately, in the last 12 months, the influx of cheaper, foreign tools has adversely impacted the firm’s profitability. Consequently, the share price has dropped sharply in recent weeks and the shareholders expressed their displeasure at the recent AGM.\nThe directors are evaluating 2 alternative investment projects which they hope will arrest the decline in profitability:\nProject 1: This would involve closing the firm’s domestic factory and switching production to a foreign country where labour rates are 1/4 of those in that domestic market. Sales will continue to be targeted exclusively as the domestic market.\nProject 2: This would involve a new investment in machinery at the domestic factory to allow production to be increased by 50%. The extra tools would be exported and sold as high quality tools in foreign market places.\nBoth projects have a positive Net Present Value when discounted at the firm’s current cost of capital.\nRequired: Discuss the strategic and financial issues that this case presents.\n(30 marks)\n\n\n\n\nFor Project 2 mentioned above, the firm’s financial manager made the following estimates.\nThe new machinery costs £4.5 million, which the supplier requires payment upfront. It would bring annual increase in revenues over the next five years of £2 million.\nThis project will lead to an increase in wage costs of £0.4 million per year and will also require expenditure of £0.3 million per year to maintain the level of existing machinery to be used on the project.\nThe following forecasts are made of the rates of inflation each year for the next five years:\n\n\n\nItem\nAnnual Inflation Rate\n\n\n\n\nRevenues\nNo inflation in revenues\n\n\nWages\n5%\n\n\nAsset maintaining expenses\n6%\n\n\n\nThe real cost of capital of the firm is 8%.
