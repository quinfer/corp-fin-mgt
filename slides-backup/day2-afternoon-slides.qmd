## Cost of Capital

This presentation covers the methods to calculate financing costs and determine optimal capital structure.

- Understanding cost of capital concepts
- Calculating costs of different financing sources
- Determining weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
- Exploring capital structure theories

## Cost of Capital Concept

The cost of capital represents:

- The return required by providers of capital
- The minimum return required for new investments
- A key component in shareholder value creation
- A benchmark for evaluating investment opportunities

## Cost of Equity Calculation Methods

The cost of equity can be calculated using several methods:

    B --> E[Dividend Growth Model]
    C --> F[CAPM Formula: E(Ri) = Rf + Î²(Rm - Rf)]
```

## Dividend Valuation Model (No Growth)

The simplest approach for calculating cost of equity:

$$k_e = \frac{D}{P_0}$$

Where:
- $k_e$ = Cost of equity
- $D$ = Annual dividend
- $P_0$ = Current share price

## Dividend Growth Model

For companies with growing dividends:

$$k_e = \frac{D_1}{P_0} + g$$

Where:
- $k_e$ = Cost of equity
- $D_1$ = Expected dividend next year
- $P_0$ = Current share price
- $g$ = Expected growth rate
