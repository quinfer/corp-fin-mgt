1. **Replacement decisions** - Replacing existing assets to maintain operations
2. **Expansion decisions** - Growing existing operations or entering new markets
3. **Improvement decisions** - Enhancing efficiency or quality
4. **Regulatory/compliance decisions** - Meeting legal requirements
5. **Strategic decisions** - Building long-term competitive advantage

## Investment Appraisal Techniques

Several techniques can be used to evaluate capital investment proposals:

- Accounting Rate of Return (ARR)
- Payback Period
- Discounted Payback Period
- Net Present Value (NPV)
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
- Profitability Index
