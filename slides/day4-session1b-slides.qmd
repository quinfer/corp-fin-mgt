## Session 1b Overview {.unnumbered}

#### **Continuing Our Strategic Analysis Journey:**

This presentation continues from Session 1a and covers:

- **External Environment Analysis**: Market dynamics and competitive landscape
- **Financial Evaluation Framework**: NPV and risk assessment integration
- **Stakeholder Impact Analysis**: Comprehensive impact evaluation
- **Professional Applications**: Legal and business advisory contexts
- **Assessment Success Strategies**: Excellence frameworks and best practices

#### **Our Focus:** 

Transform strategic frameworks into practical implementation skills

## Strategic Analysis: External Environment

#### **Market Dynamics:**
- Increasing price competition from imports
- Growing demand for sustainable/quality products
- Potential trade policy impacts (Brexit, tariffs)
- Export market opportunities vs domestic saturation

#### **Competitive Landscape:**
- Foreign low-cost producers gaining market share
- Quality differentiation under pressure
- Potential for premium positioning internationally

#### **Dividend Policy Connection:**
How might each strategic choice affect the company's ability to maintain dividends?

## Financial Evaluation Framework

#### **Option 1 (Offshore Production):**
- **Initial investment**: Factory closure costs, setup costs abroad
- **Annual cash flows**: Labour cost savings vs additional logistics/quality costs
- **Terminal value**: New production facility value
- **Discount rate**: Country risk premium adjustment needed

#### **Option 2 (Domestic Expansion):**
- **Initial investment**: £4.5 million machinery (given)
- **Annual cash flows**: Export revenue growth vs higher costs
- **Terminal value**: Machinery residual value
- **Discount rate**: Market development risk premium adjustment

## Stakeholder Impact Analysis

#### **Option 1: Offshore Production**

**Shareholders:** Potentially higher short-term returns, higher risk

**Employees:** Significant job losses, community impact

**Customers:** Maintained domestic supply at competitive prices

**Community:** Loss of local employment and economic contribution

#### **Option 2: Domestic Expansion**

**Shareholders:** Growth strategy with longer payback, more sustainable

**Employees:** Job security, potential growth opportunities

**Customers:** Continued quality focus, potential supply improvements

**Community:** Maintained local presence, potential growth

## Cost of Capital Relevance

#### **Option 1 (Offshore):**
- Higher business risk due to foreign operations
- May require higher discount rate (country risk premium adjustments)
- Currency and political risks not captured in domestic WACC

#### **Option 2 (Domestic Expansion):**
- Market development risk
- May warrant risk premium above current WACC
- But lower operational risk than offshore option

**Key Principle:** Project-specific risk adjustments may be needed when projects differ significantly from current operations

## Professional Application for Legal Advisors

#### **Due Diligence Applications:**
- Strategic analysis frameworks for M&A evaluation
- Risk assessment methodologies for client advisement
- Stakeholder impact evaluation for corporate transactions

#### **Corporate Governance:**
- Board decision-making processes
- Fiduciary duty considerations
- Stakeholder balancing requirements

#### **Regulatory Compliance:**
- Strategic decision documentation
- Risk management frameworks
- Disclosure requirements

#### **Professional Skills Development:**
- Business strategy evaluation
- Financial and legal integration
- Evidence-based decision making

## Risk Assessment Matrix

#### **Option 1: Offshore Production Risks**

| Risk Category | Likelihood | Impact |
|---------------|------------|--------|
| Quality control issues | Medium | High |
| Currency fluctuation | High | Medium |
| Political/regulatory | Low | High |
| Cultural/management | Medium | Medium |

#### **Option 2: Domestic Expansion Risks**

| Risk Category | Likelihood | Impact |
|---------------|------------|--------|
| Export market failure | Medium | High |
| Capacity utilization | Medium | Medium |
| Competition response | High | Medium |
| Regulatory barriers | Low | Medium |

## Synthesis: Bringing It All Together

#### **Decision-Making Integration:**

**From Investment Appraisal**: Both options may have positive NPV, but strategic considerations matter

**From Cost of Capital Theory**: Project-specific risk adjustments are crucial for international projects

**From Dividend Policy**: Strategic choice affects future dividend capacity and shareholder expectations

**Key Insight**: Financial analysis provides the foundation, but strategic analysis determines long-term success

## Academic Writing Quality: A Word on Word Counts ⚠️

#### **Key Principle: Substance Over Length**

The 2,000-word limit is precisely that—a **limit, not a target**. Think of it as academic headroom, not a volume to fill.

#### **What Successful Students Do:**
- **Concise, well-reasoned arguments** over verbose padding
- **Quality thinking expressed clearly** over stretched prose
- **Authentic scholarly voice** over algorithm-generated content
- **Critical analysis** over superficial coverage

#### **Areas for Development:**
- Dense text that could be more focused
- Content that could be more specific to the case
- Analysis that could integrate course concepts more clearly
- Writing that could demonstrate clearer personal insights

**Remember**: LLMs are essentially "verbosity maximizers" - they excel at generating lots of words but often sacrifice precision and insight. Your goal is the opposite: maximum insight with minimum words.

#### **AI Tools Guidance**

Remember our module principle: **LLM Premiums ≠ Premium Thinking**. 

While ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, and other premium AI tools can assist with research and grammar, your coursework success depends on *your* critical analysis and authentic insights.

#### **Professor's Perspective**

The best academic writers are those who can distill complex ideas into crystal-clear insights.

**"Some of the finest academic work I've assessed has come in well under the maximum word count. Remember that editing is as much a skill as writing. Substance over length, always.**

**Write until you've made your point brilliantly—then stop."**

*Every. Single. Word. Must. Earn. Its. Place.*
