## Welcome to Day 4: Assessment Preparation {.unnumbered}

### **Today's Journey:**

- **Session 1 (9:30-11:00)**: Strategic Analysis for Coursework Case 1
- **Session 2 (11:15-12:45)**: Advanced NPV with Inflation (Case 2)
- **Session 3 (14:00-15:30)**: EU Sustainability Directive Deep Dive
- **Session 4 (15:45-16:00)**: Exam Strategy and Final Prep

### **Our Goal:** 

Transform theoretical knowledge into practical assessment success

## Session 1 Objectives {.unnumbered}

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Apply systematic strategic analysis frameworks to business decisions
- Distinguish between strategic and operational considerations
- Evaluate stakeholder impacts in corporate decisions
- Develop professional recommendations with clear justification
- **Connect today's work to our Day 1 investment appraisal framework**

## Connecting to Our Learning Journey

**Day 1 Afternoon: Investment Appraisal**
- We learned NPV, IRR, and payback methods
- **Today**: Apply these tools to real strategic decisions

**Day 2 Afternoon: Cost of Capital**
- We calculated WACC and cost components
- **Today**: Use cost of capital in strategic evaluation

**Day 3 Morning: Dividend Policy**
- We explored distribution strategies
- **Today**: Consider how strategic choices affect shareholder returns

**Integration**: Strategic decisions must be financially sound AND strategically coherent

## Case 1: Ribs Co Strategic Challenge

**The Situation:**
- UK garden tools manufacturer
- High quality, domestic market only
- Recent challenges: cheap foreign imports
- Share price decline, shareholder displeasure
- Two strategic options under consideration

**The Decision Framework:**
Both projects have **positive NPV** at current cost of capital - but which creates more value?

:::{.callout-note}
Remember from Day 1: NPV > 0 means accept, but when choosing between projects, select the one with higher NPV and better strategic fit.

## Strategic Option 1: Offshore Production

**Strategy Type: Cost Leadership**

**Key Features:**
- Close domestic factory
- Move production to low-cost country
- Labour costs reduced by 75%
- Continue selling only in domestic market

**Day 1 Connection:**
This is fundamentally a **cost reduction project** - how would we evaluate it using NPV analysis?

## Strategic Option 2: Domestic Expansion

**Strategy Type: Differentiation + Market Development**

**Key Features:**
- £4.5 million investment in new machinery
- 50% capacity increase
- Export high-quality tools to foreign markets
- Leverage quality reputation internationally

**Day 1 Connection:**
This is a **growth investment project** - requires detailed NPV analysis with market development risks

## Strategic Analysis Framework

**Step 1: Situational Analysis**
- Current competitive position
- Market dynamics and trends
- Internal capabilities and constraints
- Stakeholder interests and pressures

**Step 2: Strategic Option Evaluation**
- Strategic coherence and fit
- Financial attractiveness (NPV, IRR)
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Implementation feasibility

**Step 3: Stakeholder Impact Analysis**
- Shareholders, employees, customers, community
- Quantitative and qualitative impacts
- Conflict resolution and trade-offs

## Applying Day 1 Investment Appraisal Concepts

**From Day 1, we learned that good investment decisions require:**

1. **Relevant Cash Flows**: Only incremental, future, after-tax flows
2. **Appropriate Discount Rate**: Reflects project risk (from Day 2 WACC)
3. **Multiple Appraisal Methods**: NPV, IRR, payback for complete picture
4. **Risk Assessment**: Sensitivity analysis and scenario planning
5. **Non-Financial Factors**: Strategic fit, implementation challenges

**Today's Application**: Use these principles for strategic choice between options

## Strategic Analysis: Internal Assessment

**Current Capabilities Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**
- High-quality product reputation
- Established domestic market presence
- Manufacturing expertise and processes
- Brand recognition in quality segment

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited geographic diversification
- Higher cost structure than competitors
- No export experience or capabilities
- Potential over-reliance on domestic market

**Critical Question**: Which option better leverages strengths and addresses weaknesses?

## Strategic Analysis: External Environment

**Market Dynamics:**
- Increasing price competition from imports
- Growing demand for sustainable/quality products
- Potential trade policy impacts (Brexit, tariffs)
- Export market opportunities vs domestic saturation

**Competitive Landscape:**
- Foreign low-cost producers gaining market share
- Quality differentiation under pressure
- Potential for premium positioning internationally

**From Day 3 Dividend Policy**: How might each strategic choice affect the company's ability to maintain dividends?

## Financial Evaluation Framework

**Using Day 1 & Day 2 Concepts:**

**Option 1 (Offshore Production):**
- Initial investment: Factory closure costs, setup costs abroad
- Annual cash flows: Labour cost savings vs additional logistics/quality costs
- Terminal value: New production facility value
- **Discount rate**: May need risk adjustment for foreign operations (Day 2 concepts)

**Option 2 (Domestic Expansion):**
- Initial investment: £4.5 million machinery (given)
- Annual cash flows: Export revenue growth vs higher costs
- Terminal value: Machinery residual value
- **Discount rate**: Market development risk adjustment

## Risk Assessment Matrix

**Option 1: Offshore Production Risks**

| Risk Category | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---------------|------------|--------|------------|
| Quality control issues | Medium | High | Strict monitoring systems |
| Currency fluctuation | High | Medium | Hedging strategies |
| Political/regulatory | Low | High | Diversified supplier base |
| Cultural/management | Medium | Medium | Local partnerships |

**Option 2: Domestic Expansion Risks**

| Risk Category | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---------------|------------|--------|------------|
| Export market failure | Medium | High | Market research, phased entry |
| Capacity utilization | Medium | Medium | Flexible production systems |
| Competition response | High | Medium | Strong differentiation |
| Regulatory barriers | Low | Medium | Compliance planning |

## Stakeholder Impact Analysis

**Shareholders:**
- **Option 1**: Potentially higher short-term returns, higher risk
- **Option 2**: Growth strategy with longer payback, more sustainable

**Employees:**
- **Option 1**: Significant job losses, community impact
- **Option 2**: Job security, potential growth opportunities

**Customers:**
- **Option 1**: Maintained domestic supply at competitive prices
- **Option 2**: Continued quality focus, potential supply improvements

**Community:**
- **Option 1**: Loss of local employment and economic contribution
- **Option 2**: Maintained local presence, potential growth

## Day 2 Cost of Capital Relevance

**Discount Rate Considerations:**

**Option 1 (Offshore):**
- Higher business risk due to foreign operations
- May require higher discount rate (remember beta adjustments from Day 2)
- Currency and political risks not captured in domestic WACC

**Option 2 (Domestic Expansion):**
- Market development risk
- May warrant risk premium above current WACC
- But lower operational risk than offshore option

**From Day 2**: Remember that project-specific risk adjustments may be needed when projects differ significantly from current operations

## Interactive Exercise: Strategic Evaluation

**Group Activity (25 minutes):**

**Teams of 3-4 students**
