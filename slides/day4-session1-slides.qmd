## Session 1 Objectives {.unnumbered}

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Apply systematic strategic analysis frameworks to business decisions

- Develop professional recommendations with clear justification
- **Connect today's work to our investment appraisal framework**

## Reality Check: 

The Educator-Assessor Balance ⚖️

#### **Let's Be Honest About This Dynamic**

I occupy two roles simultaneously: 

**your educator** and **your assessor**. 

This creates an inherent tension that you need to understand.

## **What I Can Give You:**
- ✅ **Generic frameworks** and systematic approaches
- ✅ **Conceptual guidance** on how to think about problems
- ✅ **Quality standards** and expectations
- ✅ **Key success strategies** and best practices
- ✅ **Professional development** insights

## **What I Cannot Give You:**
- ❌ **Specific answers** to your coursework questions
- ❌ **Detailed roadmaps** for your exact case analysis
- ❌ **Model solutions** that you would might be tempted to replicate
- ❌ **Assessment-specific hints** that would compromise fairness

## **Why This Tension Exists:**
- **Educational Integrity**: You need to develop independent analytical skills
- **Assessment Fairness**: All students must have equal opportunity
- **Professional Preparation**: Real-world decisions don't come with answer keys

:::{.callout-note}
**Student Learning Anxiety vs. Professional Reality**

Your anxiety about "getting it right" is understandable but misses the point. In professional practice, there's rarely one "right" answer - there are well-reasoned arguments supported by evidence. That's exactly what we're developing here.
:::

## **How to Navigate This:**
- Focus on **learning the frameworks** rather than seeking specific answers
- Develop **your authentic analytical voice** rather than trying to guess mine
- Use **evidence and reasoning** to support your arguments


## Connecting to Our Learning Journey

| Previous Learning Topic | Core Concepts | Today's Application |
|-----|------------------|---------------------|
| **Investment Appraisal** | NPV, IRR, and payback methods | Apply these tools to real strategic decisions |
| **Cost of Capital** | WACC and cost components calculation | Use cost of capital in strategic evaluation |
| **Dividend Policy** | Distribution strategies exploration | Consider how strategic choices affect shareholder returns |

**Integration**: Strategic decisions must be financially sound AND strategically coherent

## Case 1: Ribs Co Strategic Challenge

::: {.problem-statement}
**The Situation:**

- UK garden tools manufacturer
- High quality, domestic market only
- Recent challenges: cheap foreign imports
- Share price decline, shareholder displeasure
- Two strategic options under consideration
:::

#### **The Decision Framework:**
Both projects have **positive NPV** at current cost of capital - but which creates more value?

:::{.callout-note}
Remember from **Investment Appraisal**: NPV > 0 means accept, but when choosing between projects, select the one with higher NPV and better strategic fit.
:::

## Strategic Option 1: 

- Offshore Production

::: {.problem-statement}
**Strategy Type: Cost Leadership**

**Key Features:**

- Close domestic factory
- Move production to low-cost country
- Labour costs reduced by 75%
- Continue selling only in domestic market
:::

:::{.callout-important}
**Coursework Connection - Project 1**

*"This would involve closing the firm's domestic factory and switching production to a foreign country where labour rates are 1/4 of those in that domestic market. Sales will continue to be targeted exclusively as the domestic market."*
:::

#### **Investment Appraisal Connection:**
This is fundamentally a **cost reduction project** - how would we evaluate it using NPV analysis?

## Strategic Option 2: Domestic Expansion

::: {.problem-statement}
**Strategy Type: Differentiation + Market Development**

**Key Features:**

- £4.5 million investment in new machinery
- 50% capacity increase
- Export high-quality tools to foreign markets (positive cashflow potential)
- Leverage quality reputation internationally
:::

:::{.callout-important}
**Coursework Connection - Project 2**

*"This would involve a new investment in machinery at the domestic factory to allow production to be increased by 50%. The extra tools would be exported and sold as high quality tools in foreign market places."*
:::

#### **Investment Appraisal Connection:**
This is a **growth investment project** - requires detailed NPV analysis with market development risks

## Applying Investment Appraisal Concepts

**From investment appraisal theory, we learned that good investment decisions require:**

1. **Relevant Cash Flows**: Only incremental, future, after-tax flows
2. **Appropriate Discount Rate**: Reflects project risk (using WACC principles)
3. **Multiple Appraisal Methods**: NPV, IRR, payback for complete picture
4. **Risk Assessment**: Sensitivity analysis and scenario planning
5. **Non-Financial Factors**: Strategic fit, implementation challenges

**Today's Application**: Use these principles for strategic choice between options

## Strategic Analysis: Internal Assessment

<!-- Slide rendering check -->

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}
#### **Strengths:**
- High-quality product reputation
- Established domestic market presence
- Manufacturing expertise and processes
- Brand recognition in quality segment

#### **Critical Question:**
Which option better leverages strengths and addresses weaknesses?
:::

::: {.g-col-6}
#### **Weaknesses:**
- Limited geographic diversification
- Higher cost structure than competitors
- No export experience or capabilities
- Potential over-reliance on domestic market
:::

:::

## Strategic Analysis: External Environment

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}
#### **Market Dynamics:**
- Increasing price competition from imports
- Growing demand for sustainable/quality products
- Potential trade policy impacts (Brexit, tariffs)
- Export market opportunities vs domestic saturation
:::

::: {.g-col-6}
#### **Competitive Landscape:**
- Foreign low-cost producers gaining market share
- Quality differentiation under pressure
- Potential for premium positioning internationally

#### **Dividend Policy Connection:**
How might each strategic choice affect the company's ability to maintain dividends?
:::

:::

## Financial Evaluation Framework

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}
#### **Option 1 (Offshore Production):**
- **Initial investment**: Factory closure costs, setup costs abroad
- **Annual cash flows**: Labour cost savings vs additional logistics/quality costs
- **Terminal value**: New production facility value
- **Discount rate**: Country risk premium adjustment needed
:::

::: {.g-col-6}
#### **Option 2 (Domestic Expansion):**
- **Initial investment**: £4.5 million machinery (given)
- **Annual cash flows**: Export revenue growth vs higher costs
- **Terminal value**: Machinery residual value
- **Discount rate**: Market development risk premium adjustment
:::

:::

## Stakeholder Impact Analysis

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}
#### **Option 1: Offshore Production**

**Shareholders:** Potentially higher short-term returns, higher risk

**Employees:** Significant job losses, community impact

**Customers:** Maintained domestic supply at competitive prices

**Community:** Loss of local employment and economic contribution
:::

::: {.g-col-6}
#### **Option 2: Domestic Expansion**

**Shareholders:** Growth strategy with longer payback, more sustainable

**Employees:** Job security, potential growth opportunities

**Customers:** Continued quality focus, potential supply improvements

**Community:** Maintained local presence, potential growth
:::

:::

## Cost of Capital Relevance

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}
#### **Option 1 (Offshore):**
- Higher business risk due to foreign operations
- May require higher discount rate (country risk premium adjustments)
- Currency and political risks not captured in domestic WACC
:::

::: {.g-col-6}
#### **Option 2 (Domestic Expansion):**
- Market development risk
- May warrant risk premium above current WACC
- But lower operational risk than offshore option

**Key Principle:** Project-specific risk adjustments may be needed when projects differ significantly from current operations

## Academic Writing Quality: A Word on Word Counts ⚠️

#### **Key Principle: Substance Over Length**

The 2,000-word limit is precisely that—a **limit, not a target**. Think of it as academic headroom, not a volume to fill.

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}
#### **What Successful Students Do:**
- **Concise, well-reasoned arguments** over verbose padding
- **Quality thinking expressed clearly** over stretched prose
- **Authentic scholarly voice** over algorithm-generated content
- **Critical analysis** over superficial coverage
:::

::: {.g-col-6}
#### **Areas for Development:**
- Dense text that could be more focused
- Content that could be more specific to the case
- Analysis that could integrate course concepts more clearly
- Writing that could demonstrate clearer personal insights
:::

:::

:::{.callout-tip}
**Remember**: LLMs are essentially "verbosity maximizers" - they excel at generating lots of words but often sacrifice precision and insight. Your goal is the opposite: maximum insight with minimum words.
:::

:::{.callout-important}
**AI Tools Guidance**

Remember our module principle: **LLM Premiums ≠ Premium Thinking**. 

While ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, and other premium AI tools can assist with research and grammar, your coursework success depends on *your* critical analysis and authentic insights.

**Professor's Perspective**

The best academic writers are those who can distill complex ideas into crystal-clear insights.

**"Some of the finest academic work I've assessed has come in well under the maximum word count. Remember that editing is as much a skill as writing. Substance over length, always.**

**Write until you've made your point brilliantly—then stop."**

*Every. Single. Word. Must. Earn. Its. Place.*
