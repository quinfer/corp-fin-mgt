## What Is the Cost of Capital? {.unnumbered}

Think of the cost of capital as the "price tag" a company must pay to obtain funding for its operations and investments.

:::{.callout-note}
## Learning Outcomes for This Session
By the end of this afternoon, you will be able to:

1. Explain what cost of capital means in practical terms
2. Understand why different sources of finance have different costs
3. Calculate the overall cost of funding for a business
4. Apply these concepts to evaluate whether investments make financial sense
5. Appreciate how capital structure decisions affect business value
:::

Just as you might pay different interest rates on a mortgage versus a credit card, companies face different costs depending on how they choose to finance their activities.

## Two Perspectives on Cost of Capital

**From the Investor's Viewpoint:**

The cost of capital represents the return they could earn by investing their money elsewhere in similarly risky ventures. This is their "opportunity cost."

**From the Company's Viewpoint:**

The cost of capital is the minimum return the company must provide to keep investors happy and willing to continue providing funds.

:::{.callout-important}
## The Golden Rule
Any investment project should generate returns that at least cover the company's cost of obtaining the money to fund it. This is why understanding cost of capital is crucial for sound business decisions.
:::

## The Funding Menu: Sources of Capital

Companies can obtain long-term funding from several sources, each with its own characteristics and costs:

**External Sources:**

- **Ordinary Shares** – Selling ownership stakes to investors
- **Preference Shares** – Shares with fixed dividend payments
- **Bank Loans** – Borrowed money with agreed interest rates
- **Corporate Bonds** – IOUs sold to investors with fixed interest payments

**Internal Sources:**

- **Retained Earnings** – Profits kept within the business rather than paid as dividends

## Understanding the Funding Landscape

    B --> E[Corporate Bonds]
    C --> F[Ordinary Shares]
    C --> G[Preference Shares]
    C --> H[Retained Earnings]
```

Each funding source comes with different obligations, costs, and risks for the company.

## The Cost of Equity: What Shareholders Expect

Equity represents ownership in the company. When someone buys shares, they're effectively becoming a part-owner and expect to be compensated for the risks they're taking.

**Key Insight:**

Even retained earnings (profits kept in the business) have a cost – shareholders could have received these as dividends and invested them elsewhere.

## Valuing Equity: Market Price Considerations

When calculating the cost of equity, we need to use the current market value of shares, but with some important adjustments:

**Ex-Dividend vs Cum-Dividend Pricing:**

- **Cum-dividend:**
  Share price includes upcoming dividend payment (like buying a house with the fixtures included)
- **Ex-dividend:**
  Share price after dividend has been paid (like buying the house without the fixtures)

For cost calculations, we use ex-dividend prices because they reflect the true ongoing value without one-off payments.

## Practical Example: Share Valuation

**Scenario:**
Invierno plc has 2 million shares trading at 240p each. A dividend of 22p per share is about to be paid.

**For cost of capital purposes:**

- Current price (cum-dividend): 240p
- Upcoming dividend: 22p
- Ex-dividend price: 240p - 22p = 218p
- Total market value: 218p × 2,000,000 = £4,360,000

**Why This Matters:**

Using the cum-dividend price would overvalue the equity and underestimate the cost of capital, leading to poor investment decisions.

## Calculating the Cost of Equity: Two Main Approaches

**Method 1: The Dividend Approach**

Focuses on what investors actually receive from their shareholding

**Method 2: The Risk-Based Approach (CAPM)**

Focuses on what return investors require given the risks they're taking

Both methods aim to answer the same question: "What return do shareholders expect for investing in this company?"

## Method 1: The Dividend Approach - Simple Version

For investments that pay a constant dividend (like preference shares), the calculation is straightforward:

**Required Return = Annual Dividend ÷ Current Share Price**

**Example:**

- Annual dividend: 16p per share
- Current share price (ex-dividend): £1.80
- Required return: 16p ÷ £1.80 = 8.89%

**Plain English:**
If you pay £1.80 for a share that pays 16p annually forever, you're earning an 8.89% return on your investment.

## Method 1: The Dividend Approach - Growth Version

When dividends are expected to grow over time, we need to account for this growth:

**Required Return = (Next Year's Expected Dividend ÷ Current Price) + Growth Rate**

**Example:**

- Current dividend: 16p per share
- Expected growth: 7% per year
- Next year's dividend: 16p × 1.07 = 17.12p
- Current share price: £1.88
- Required return: (17.12p ÷ £1.88) + 7% = 9.11% + 7% = 16.11%

**The Logic:**
Investors expect returns from both regular dividend payments AND the capital growth as dividends increase.

## Calculating Historical Growth Rates

To estimate future growth, we often look at past dividend patterns:

**Example: Five Years of Dividends**

- 2015: £341,055
- 2014: £318,500
- 2013: £267,800
- 2012: £249,600
- 2011: £195,000

**The Calculation Process:**

- Total growth over 4 years: £341,055 ÷ £195,000 = 1.749 (or 74.9% total growth)
- Annual growth rate: (1.749)^(1/4) - 1 = 15% per year

**What This Tells Us:**
Dividends have been growing at 15% annually, which might continue into the future.

## Limitations of the Dividend Method

**Practical Challenges:**

- Many companies pay irregular dividends or no dividends at all
- Past growth may not predict future performance
- Assumes smooth, predictable dividend growth
- Ignores capital gains (increases in share price)
- Very sensitive to assumptions about growth rates

**When It Works Best:**

- Companies with stable, predictable dividend policies
- Mature businesses with consistent cash generation
- Preference shares with fixed payments

## Method 2: The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

CAPM takes a different approach by focusing on risk and return relationships in the broader market.

**The Core Idea:**

Investors require higher returns for taking higher risks. CAPM quantifies this relationship.

## Understanding Risk in Investment

**Two Types of Risk:**

**Unique Risk (Unsystematic Risk):**

- Specific to individual companies or industries
- Examples: Labour strikes, management changes, product recalls
- Can be eliminated through diversification (holding different types of investments)

**Market Risk (Systematic Risk):**

- Affects the entire market
- Examples: Interest rate changes, economic recessions, inflation
- Cannot be diversified away – everyone faces these risks

**Key Insight:**
Since investors can eliminate unique risk through diversification, they only require compensation for market risk.

## Beta: Measuring Market Risk

Beta (β) measures how sensitive a company's shares are to overall market movements:

- **Beta = 1:**
  Company moves in line with the market
- **Beta > 1:**
  Company is more volatile than the market (higher risk)
- **Beta < 1:**
  Company is less volatile than the market (lower risk)

**Real-World Examples:**

- Utility companies often have beta < 1 (stable, defensive businesses)
- Technology startups often have beta > 1 (highly sensitive to market sentiment)
- Mining companies might have beta = 2 (twice as volatile as the market)

## The CAPM Formula in Plain English

**Required Return = Risk-Free Rate + (Beta × Market Risk Premium)**

**What Each Component Means:**

- **Risk-Free Rate:**
  Return on safest investments (government bonds)
- **Beta:**
  How much riskier the company is than the market average
- **Market Risk Premium:**
  Extra return demanded for investing in shares rather than safe bonds

**Example:**

- Risk-free rate: 3%
- Company beta: 1.2
- Market return: 8%
- Market risk premium: 8% - 3% = 5%
- Required return: 3% + (1.2 × 5%) = 3% + 6% = 9%

## CAPM Example Walkthrough

**Scenario:**
M plc has a beta of 1.2, government bonds yield 3%, and the stock market average return is 8%.

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. Risk-free rate = 3%
2. Market return = 8%
3. Market risk premium = 8% - 3% = 5%
4. Company beta = 1.2
5. Required return = 3% + 1.2 × 5% = 3% + 6% = 9%

**Interpretation:**
Because this company is 20% riskier than the market average (beta = 1.2), investors require a 9% return compared to the 8% market average.

## Comparing the Two Methods

| Dividend Growth Model | CAPM |
|----------------------|------|
| Based on actual dividend payments | Based on risk relationships |
| Requires dividend history | Can be applied to any listed company |
| Simple and intuitive | More theoretically robust |
| Sensitive to growth assumptions | Requires market data and beta calculation |
| Good for mature, dividend-paying companies | Good for all types of companies |

**Best Practice:**
Use both methods when possible and compare results for reasonableness.

## The Cost of Debt: Borrowed Money

Debt financing involves borrowing money with a legal obligation to repay with interest. The cost calculation depends on the type of debt.

## Two Main Types of Debt

**Untraded Debt (Bank Loans):**

- Negotiated directly with banks
- Interest rate agreed at outset
- Market value equals the amount borrowed
- Cost = Interest rate × (1 - Tax Rate)

**Traded Debt (Corporate Bonds):**

- Sold to investors in financial markets
- Can be bought and sold like shares
- Market value fluctuates based on interest rates
- More complex cost calculations required

## Why Debt Is Cheaper Than Equity

**Tax Benefits:**

Interest payments on debt are tax-deductible, making debt cheaper for companies.

**Example:**

- Bank loan interest rate: 8%
- Corporate tax rate: 30%
- After-tax cost of debt: 8% × (1 - 30%) = 8% × 70% = 5.6%

**Lower Risk for Lenders:**

- Debt holders have legal priority over shareholders
- Interest must be paid before dividends
- Lenders have security/collateral backing
- Therefore, lenders accept lower returns

## Corporate Bonds: A Deeper Look

Corporate bonds are essentially IOUs that companies sell to raise money:

**Key Features:**

- Face value (usually £100 per bond)
- Fixed annual interest payment (coupon)
- Set maturity date for repayment
- Tradeable on financial markets

**Market Value Calculation:**

Bond prices fluctuate based on current interest rates and the company's creditworthiness.

## Bond Valuation Example

**ABC PLC Bond Details:**

- £2,000,000 total bonds
- 8% annual interest (coupon)
- Repayable at face value in 3 years
- Current market interest rate for similar bonds: 5%

**Market Value Logic:**

Investors compare the 8% coupon to current 5% rates. Since the bond pays more than current rates, it trades at a premium above face value.

**Calculation Result:**

Each £100 bond is worth approximately £108.17, making the total market value £2,163,400.

## Calculating the Cost of Traded Debt

The cost of traded debt uses the same logic as calculating a loan's interest rate, but in reverse:

**Given:**

- Current market price of the bond
- Annual interest payments (after tax)
- Final repayment amount and timing

**Find:**

The interest rate that makes these future cash flows equal to today's market price.

## Bond Cost Calculation Example

**Derry PLC Bond:**

- £5,000,000 of 8% bonds
- Currently trading at £92 per £100 bond
- 4 years until maturity
- Company tax rate: 50%

**After-tax interest per bond:**
£8 × (1-50%) = £4

**Annual cash flow per bond:**
£4 for 4 years, then £100 repayment

**Finding the Cost:**

What interest rate makes £4 annually for 4 years plus £100 final payment worth £92 today? Answer: approximately 6.61%

## Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)

WACC combines the costs of debt and equity based on their relative importance in the company's financing.

**The Concept:**

If you finance 60% with equity (costing 12%) and 40% with debt (costing 6%), your overall cost is:
(60% × 12%) + (40% × 6%) = 7.2% + 2.4% = 9.6%

## WACC Formula in Plain English

**WACC = (Equity Weight × Cost of Equity) + (Debt Weight × After-tax Cost of Debt)**

**Where the weights are:**

- Equity Weight = Market Value of Equity ÷ Total Value
- Debt Weight = Market Value of Debt ÷ Total Value

**Important:**
Use market values, not book values, as these reflect current investor valuations.

## WACC Calculation Example

**Primavero Plc:**

- Equity market value: £2 million
- Debt market value: £2 million
- Cost of equity: 16%
- Cost of debt (before tax): 12.5%
- Tax rate: 20%

**Step-by-Step:**

1. Total value = £2m + £2m = £4m
2. Equity weight = £2m ÷ £4m = 50%
3. Debt weight = £2m ÷ £4m = 50%
4. After-tax cost of debt = 12.5% × (1-20%) = 10%
5. WACC = (50% × 16%) + (50% × 10%) = 8% + 5% = 13%

## When to Use WACC for Investment Decisions

WACC is appropriate as a discount rate when:

**The Investment Matches the Business:**

- Similar risk profile to existing operations
- Financed in same proportions as current capital structure
- Company's financing mix is optimal

**When WACC May Not Be Suitable:**

- Project is significantly riskier or safer than normal business
- Different financing arrangement planned
- Major change in company's risk profile

## Capital Structure: The Debt-Equity Mix

Capital structure refers to how a company chooses to finance its operations – the balance between debt and equity funding.

**The Central Question:**

What mix of debt and equity minimises the overall cost of capital and maximises company value?

## The Capital Structure Trade-Off

**Benefits of Debt:**

- Lower cost due to tax deductibility
- No dilution of existing shareholders' control
- Fixed payment obligations

**Costs of Debt:**

- Increased financial risk and potential bankruptcy
- Fixed obligations regardless of company performance
- Restrictive lending covenants

**The Balancing Act:**

Companies must find the optimal level where the benefits of cheaper debt are balanced against the increased financial risk.

## Financial Risk Explained

**Operating Risk:**
Uncertainty about business performance

**Financial Risk:**
Additional uncertainty created by debt obligations

**Example:**

Two identical businesses, one financed entirely by equity, one with 50% debt:
- In good years, the leveraged company's shareholders earn much higher returns
- In bad years, they may face significant losses or bankruptcy
- The debt creates amplified volatility in shareholder returns

## The Modigliani-Miller Theory

This influential theory suggests that in perfect markets:

**Key Proposition:**

Company value is determined by its investment opportunities and operating performance, not how it's financed.

**The Logic:**

Any benefit from cheaper debt is exactly offset by shareholders demanding higher returns due to increased financial risk.

**Real-World Implications:**

While perfect markets don't exist, the theory highlights that financing decisions should focus on operational performance and tax considerations rather than attempting to "trick" the market.

## Practical Applications for Legal Professionals

**Due Diligence in M&A:**

- Evaluate target company's cost of capital
- Assess whether current capital structure is optimal
- Consider post-acquisition financing implications

**Corporate Restructuring:**

- Understand how capital structure changes affect value
- Evaluate impact of debt refinancing on shareholders
- Consider tax implications of different financing arrangements

**Investment Committee Decisions:**

- Ensure proposed investments exceed cost of capital
- Understand how project risks affect required returns
- Evaluate financing options for major investments

## Common Cost of Capital Pitfalls

**Mistakes to Avoid:**

- Using book values instead of market values
- Ignoring tax benefits of debt
- Applying WACC to projects with different risk profiles
- Overlooking flotation costs for new financing
- Using historical data without considering future changes

**Best Practices:**

- Regularly update cost calculations
- Consider multiple estimation methods
- Adjust for project-specific risks
- Consider market conditions and company circumstances

## Final Reflection: Models as Tools for Insight {.unnumbered}

:::{.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
> **"All models are wrong, but some are useful."** — *George Box*

The cost of capital isn't a single, precise number — it's a framework for thinking critically about funding and risk. The models we've explored today are tools for reasoning under uncertainty, not formulas for absolute truth.

**Key Learning Philosophy:**

- **Experiment confidently:**
  Use the Excel workbook to test assumptions and break things
- **Question everything:**
  Ask why growth rates should continue, whether betas are stable, if markets are truly efficient
- **Focus on insight over precision:**
  Understanding the relationships matters more than calculating to the fourth decimal place
- **Apply contextually:**
  Every company, industry, and situation has unique factors that models can't fully capture

**For Legal Professionals:**

Your role isn't to become a financial modeller, but to understand these concepts well enough to:
- Ask the right questions during due diligence
- Evaluate the reasonableness of financial projections
- Understand how financing decisions affect client interests
- Communicate effectively with financial professionals and clients

The confidence to engage with these concepts — not perfect technical mastery — is what will serve you best in practice.
