## Quick Formula Reference

#### **Investment Appraisal Formulas:**
- **NPV** = Σ[CF_t/(1+r)^t] - Initial Investment
- **IRR interpolation**: Rate₁ + [NPV₁/(NPV₁-NPV₂)] × (Rate₂-Rate₁)

#### **Cost of Capital Formulas:**
- **CAPM**: r_e = r_f + β(r_m - r_f)
- **WACC** = (E/V)×r_e + (D/V)×r_d×(1-T)
- **Dividend Model**: r_e = (D₁/P₀) + g

#### **Key Ratio Formulas:**
- **Gearing** = Debt/(Debt + Equity)
- **Dividend Payout** = Dividends/Earnings

#### **Essential for Memorization:**
These formulas form the foundation for all calculations in Sections A and B

**Professional Application**: These same formulas are used in legal practice for M&A and corporate advisory work

## Section A Strategy: Question 1 Type

#### **Typical Structure** (Based on Oakland Plc example):
- **(a) NPV calculation** - 12 marks (20 minutes)
- **(b) IRR evaluation** - 5 marks (8 minutes)  
- **(c) DPP analysis** - 5 marks (8 minutes)

#### **Professional Standards**: Write as if advising a client in legal practice

## Quick NPV Checklist

#### **✓ Identify ALL relevant cash flows:**
- Initial investment (including working capital)
- Annual operating cash flows (incremental only)
- Terminal values (working capital recovery, asset disposal)
- Opportunity costs (foregone rental income, etc.)

#### **✓ Apply discount rate correctly:**
- Use given cost of capital
- Apply consistently to all cash flows
- Consider whether adjustments needed for project risk

#### **✓ Present calculations professionally:**

- Total value = £50m
- WACC = (30/50)×14% + (20/50)×8%×(1-0.25)
