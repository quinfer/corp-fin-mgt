## Final Session Overview {.unnumbered}

**Session Focus**: Exam success strategy and course integration

**Time Remaining**: 15 minutes for maximum impact

**Objectives**:
- Master time management for exam success
- Review key concepts and connections
- Practice rapid problem-solving techniques
- **Integrate four days of learning into exam performance**

**Goal**: Transform knowledge into exam success and professional capability

## Exam Structure Recap

**Section A - Compulsory (60 marks, 90 minutes)**:
- **Question 1**: Investment appraisal (NPV, IRR, DPP) - 30 marks
- **Question 2**: WACC calculation and capital structure - 30 marks

**Section B - Choose 2 from 3 (40 marks, 90 minutes)**:
- **Question 3**: Small business finance - 20 marks
- **Question 4**: Dividend policy - 20 marks  
- **Question 5**: Advanced cost of capital (NEW) - 20 marks

**Total Time**: 3 hours (180 minutes)

## Time Management Strategy

**Section A Time Allocation (90 minutes)**:
- **Reading and planning**: 10 minutes total
- **Question 1**: 40 minutes (including 5 minutes checking)
- **Question 2**: 40 minutes (including 5 minutes checking)

**Section B Time Allocation (90 minutes)**:
- **Question selection**: 5 minutes maximum
- **Each chosen question**: 42.5 minutes
- **Final review**: 5 minutes

**Golden Rule**: Stick to time limits - partial answers better than no answers

## Quick Formula Reference

**Essential Formulas (Memorize These)**:

**Investment Appraisal**:
- NPV = Σ[CF_t/(1+r)^t] - Initial Investment
- IRR interpolation: Rate₁ + [NPV₁/(NPV₁-NPV₂)] × (Rate₂-Rate₁)

**Cost of Capital**:
- CAPM: r_e = r_f + β(r_m - r_f)
- WACC = (E/V)×r_e + (D/V)×r_d×(1-T)
- Dividend Model: r_e = (D₁/P₀) + g

**Key Ratios**:
- Gearing = Debt/(Debt + Equity)
- Dividend Payout = Dividends/Earnings

## Section A Strategy: Question 1 Type

**Typical Structure** (Based on Oakland Plc example):
- (a) NPV calculation - 12 marks (20 minutes)
- (b) IRR evaluation - 5 marks (8 minutes)  
- (c) DPP analysis - 5 marks (8 minutes)
- (d) Board memo with non-financial factors - 8 marks (12 minutes)

**Day 1 Connection**: Use systematic approach from investment appraisal session

**Success Tips**:
- Show all workings clearly
- State decision criteria explicitly
- Consider working capital and opportunity costs
- Use professional memo format for part (d)

## Quick NPV Checklist

**✓ Identify ALL relevant cash flows**:
- Initial investment (including working capital)
- Annual operating cash flows (incremental only)
- Terminal values (working capital recovery, asset disposal)
- Opportunity costs (foregone rental income, etc.)

**✓ Apply discount rate correctly**:
- Use given cost of capital
- Apply consistently to all cash flows
- Consider whether adjustments needed for project risk

**✓ Present calculations professionally**:
- Clear tabular format with years, cash flows, PV factors, present values
- Show NPV calculation and decision clearly

## Section A Strategy: Question 2 Type

**Typical Structure** (Based on Triglass Plc example):
- (a) Debt vs equity explanation - 5 marks (8 minutes)
- (b) Beta and CAPM concepts - 5 marks (8 minutes)
- (c) WACC calculation - 15 marks (20 minutes)
- (d) Gearing analysis - 5 marks (8 minutes)

**Day 2 Connection**: Apply cost of capital concepts systematically

**Success Tips**:
- Use market values, not book values
- Apply tax shields to debt only
- Show component calculations clearly
- Explain concepts in practical terms

## Quick WACC Checklist

**✓ Calculate market values correctly**:
- Ordinary shares: Number × Current market price
- Preference shares: Number × Current market price
- Bonds: Book value × (Market price/Par value)
- Bank loans: Book value = Market value

**✓ Calculate component costs**:
- Equity: Use CAPM or dividend model
- Preference shares: Annual dividend/Market price
- Debt: Yield to maturity × (1 - Tax rate)

**✓ Apply weights correctly**:
- Use market value weights
- Ensure weights sum to 100%

## Section B Strategy: Question Selection

**Choose Based on Strength and Time Requirements**:

**Question 3 (Small Business Finance)**:
- Heavy on discussion and explanation
- Less calculation-intensive
- Good if comfortable with descriptive analysis

**Question 4 (Dividend Policy)**:
- Mix of theory and practical application
- **Day 3 connection**: Use dividend policy frameworks
- Moderate calculation requirements

**Question 5 (Advanced WACC)**:
- High calculation content
- International business context
- **Day 2 advanced connection**: Risk-adjusted discount rates

## Rapid Problem-Solving Technique

**For ANY Calculation Question**:

1. **Read and understand** (2 minutes)

   - What method should be used?

2. **Plan approach** (1 minute)  
   - Identify steps required
   - Note any assumptions needed
   - Consider time allocation

3. **Execute calculation** (35 minutes)
   - Work systematically through steps
   - Show all workings clearly
   - Check reasonableness of answers

4. **Review and finalize** (2 minutes)
   - Check arithmetic
   - Ensure all parts answered
   - Verify decision logic

## Quick Practice: Investment Appraisal

**Rapid Calculation Exercise (2 minutes)**:

Project costs £50,000, generates £15,000 annually for 5 years, 12% cost of capital.

**Your Answer**:
- NPV = £15,000 × 3.605 - £50,000 = £4,075
- Decision: Accept (NPV > 0)

**Key Learning**: Practice standard calculations for speed and accuracy

## Quick Practice: WACC Calculation

**Rapid Calculation Exercise (2 minutes)**:

Company has:
- £30m equity (cost 14%)
- £20m debt (cost 8%, tax rate 25%)

**Your Answer**:
- Total value = £50m
- WACC = (30/50)×14% + (20/50)×8%×(1-0.25)
- WACC = 8.4% + 2.4% = 10.8%
