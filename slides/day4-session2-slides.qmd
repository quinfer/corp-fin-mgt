## Connecting to Investment Appraisal Fundamentals

#### **Core NPV Principles:**
- Identify relevant cash flows (incremental, future, after-tax)
- Apply appropriate discount rate
- Calculate present value of all cash flows
- Decision rule: Accept if NPV > 0

#### **Today's Advanced Application:**
- Multiple inflation rates affecting different cost categories
- Real vs nominal rate applications
- Sensitivity analysis for risk assessment
- Professional presentation of complex calculations

**Key Insight**: Same principles, more sophisticated application

## Case 2: Ribs Co Domestic Expansion

#### **Project Details:**
- New machinery cost: £4.5 million (upfront)
- Annual revenue increase: £2 million
- Annual wage cost increase: £0.4 million
- Annual maintenance cost: £0.3 million
- Project life: 5 years
- **All cash flows stated in real terms**

#### **The Inflation Challenge:**
- Revenues: 0% inflation (fixed contracts)
- Wages: 5% annual inflation
- Maintenance: 6% annual inflation
- General inflation: 3.5%
- Real cost of capital: 8%

**Coursework Connection - Case 2 Requirements**

This session directly addresses:

**Requirement 1 (20 marks)**: "Determine the NPV of this project"
**Requirement 2 (10 marks)**: "Analyse the project's sensitivity to annual revenue. What is the minimum revenue figure for the project to breakeven?"

These are exactly the specifications from your coursework assignment.

## Investment Appraisal Review: What Are Relevant Cash Flows?

#### **Cash Flow Criteria:**
- **Incremental**: Only arising from this project
- **Future**: Ignore sunk costs
- **After-tax**: Consider tax implications (ignore tax here)

#### **Today's Application:**
- **Revenue increase**: £2m additional sales ✓
- **Wage increase**: £0.4m additional labour costs ✓
- **Maintenance**: £0.3m additional upkeep ✓
- **Initial investment**: £4.5m machinery ✓

**Note**: No working capital mentioned, no tax considerations, no terminal value

## Understanding Inflation Impact

#### **Key Concepts:**

**Real Terms**: Purchasing power terms, inflation removed

**Nominal Terms**: Actual cash amounts including inflation

**Today's Data**: Given in real terms for Year 1, but each category inflates at different rates thereafter

#### **The Challenge:**

Year 1 base amounts (real):
- £2m revenue
- £0.4m wages  
- £0.3m maintenance

**Key Question**: How do we handle differential inflation rates properly?

## Method 1: Real Cash Flows, Real Discount Rate

**Approach**: Keep everything in real terms, use real discount rate

#### **Year 1 Base Amounts:**
- Revenue: £2,000,000
- Wages: £400,000  
- Maintenance: £300,000
- **Net cash flow: £1,300,000**

#### **Important Insight:**
**Real cash flows decline over time** because wages and maintenance inflate while revenue doesn't!

This reflects the economic reality of cost pressures.

## Real Cash Flow Projections

**Inflation-Adjusted Real Cash Flows:**

| Year | Revenue | Wages | Maintenance | Net Cash Flow |
|------|---------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | £2,000,000 | £400,000 | £300,000 | £1,300,000 |
| 2 | £2,000,000 | £420,000 | £318,000 | £1,262,000 |
| 3 | £2,000,000 | £441,000 | £337,080 | £1,221,920 |
| 4 | £2,000,000 | £463,050 | £357,305 | £1,179,645 |
| 5 | £2,000,000 | £486,203 | £378,743 | £1,135,054 |

**Calculation Example:**
- Year 2 wages: £400,000 × 1.05 = £420,000
- Year 2 maintenance: £300,000 × 1.06 = £318,000

## NPV Calculation: Method 1

**Using Real Discount Rate (8%):**

| Year | Cash Flow | PV Factor (8%) | Present Value |
|------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| 0 | (£4,500,000) | 1.000 | (£4,500,000) |
| 1 | £1,300,000 | 0.926 | £1,203,800 |
| 2 | £1,262,000 | 0.857 | £1,081,534 |
| 3 | £1,221,920 | 0.794 | £970,604 |
| 4 | £1,179,645 | 0.735 | £867,039 |
| 5 | £1,135,054 | 0.681 | £772,772 |

**NPV = £395,749**

**Investment Decision**: NPV > 0, so accept the project!

**Coursework Application - Requirement 1**

This calculation directly answers "Determine the NPV of this project" (20 marks). In your coursework, show:
- Clear cash flow projections
- Proper inflation adjustments
- Step-by-step NPV calculation
- Professional presentation

## Method 2: Nominal Cash Flows, Nominal Discount Rate

#### **Step 1: Calculate Nominal Discount Rate**

Fisher Effect Formula:

Nominal = (1 + Real) × (1 + Inflation) - 1

Nominal rate = (1.08 × 1.035) - 1 = **11.78%**

#### **Step 2: Convert to Nominal Cash Flows**

Inflate each year's real cash flow by general inflation (3.5%):

| Year | Real CF | Inflation Factor | Nominal CF |
|------|---------|------------------|------------|
| 1 | £1,300,000 | 1.035 | £1,345,500 |
| 2 | £1,262,000 | 1.071 | £1,351,602 |

## NPV Calculation: Method 2

**Using Nominal Discount Rate (11.78%):**

| Year | Nominal Cash Flow | PV Factor (11.78%) | Present Value |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 0 | (£4,500,000) | 1.000 | (£4,500,000) |
| 1 | £1,345,500 | 0.895 | £1,204,222 |
| 2 | £1,351,602 | 0.801 | £1,082,433 |
| 3 | £1,355,109 | 0.716 | £970,858 |
| 4 | £1,354,616 | 0.641 | £868,311 |
| 5 | £1,348,444 | 0.573 | £772,660 |

**NPV = £398,484**

**Result**: Very close to Method 1 (£395,749) - small differences due to rounding

## Key Learning: Consistency Is Critical

#### **Both Methods Give Same Answer:**
- Method 1: Real cash flows with real discount rate
- Method 2: Nominal cash flows with nominal discount rate

**Critical Success Factor**: Choose one method and apply consistently throughout analysis

#### **Important Warning:**
**Never mix approaches** - using real cash flows with nominal rates (or vice versa) will give incorrect results

**Professional Practice**: Consistency in assumptions is crucial for accurate investment appraisal

## Building on Investment Appraisal: Sensitivity Analysis

#### **Core Concept:**
Test how sensitive NPV is to key assumptions

**Business Question**: How much can annual revenue decline before the project becomes unprofitable (NPV = 0)?

#### **Method:**
Set NPV equation to zero and solve for revenue level

**Professional Application**: Provides management with risk assessment and confidence levels

## Revenue Sensitivity Calculation

**Setting Up the Analysis:**

Let R = annual revenue (currently £2,000,000)
Other costs inflate as calculated previously

#### **Solution Process:**
1. Express each year's net cash flow as function of R
2. Calculate present value of these cash flows
3. Set total equal to £4,500,000
4. Solve for R

#### **Results:**
**Breakeven Revenue**: £1,124,000 per year

**Risk Assessment**: Revenue can decline by 43.8% before project becomes unprofitable

**Coursework Application - Requirement 2**

This analysis directly answers "What is the minimum revenue figure for the project to breakeven?" (10 marks).

**Your Answer**: £1,124,000 per year is the minimum revenue for NPV = 0.

## Sensitivity Analysis Results

**Comprehensive Risk Assessment:**

| Revenue Scenario | Annual Revenue | NPV | Decision |
|------------------|----------------|-----|----------|
| Optimistic (+20%) | £2,400,000 | £743,456 | Accept |
| Base Case | £2,000,000 | £395,749 | Accept |
| Pessimistic (-20%) | £1,600,000 | £48,042 | Accept |
| Breakeven | £1,124,000 | £0 | Indifferent |
| Worst Case (-50%) | £1,000,000 | (£269,374) | Reject |

**Management Insight**: Project remains viable even with significant revenue shortfalls, providing confidence in the investment decision

## Connecting to Cost of Capital Principles

#### **Risk Considerations:**
- Market development risk (entering export markets)
- Currency exposure from international sales
- Operational risks from capacity expansion

**Question**: Should we use the company's current WACC?

#### **Professional Practice:**
**Potential Adjustment**: May warrant risk premium above current WACC

**Cost of Capital Theory**: Discount rate should reflect project-specific risks, not just company average

## Excel Modeling Best Practices

#### **Professional Model Structure:**
1. **Assumptions Section**: All key inputs clearly highlighted
2. **Calculation Section**: Step-by-step cash flow development  
3. **Results Section**: NPV, IRR, sensitivity analysis

#### **Additional Methods:**
**IRR Calculation**: Find rate where NPV = 0
- **Expected Result**: IRR > 8% real cost of capital

**Payback Period**: Time to recover initial investment
- **Calculation**: Approximately 3.5-4 years

#### **Investment Appraisal Principle:**
Use multiple methods for comprehensive evaluation, but NPV remains the primary decision criterion

**Professional Standard**: Triangulate results using different approaches for robust analysis
