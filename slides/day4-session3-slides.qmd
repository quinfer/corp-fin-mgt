## Understanding Cost Estimation Methodology

#### **Reality Check: Source of Cost Estimates**

**These are professional estimates based on my research using the following:**

- Industry benchmarking data
- Consultancy firm cost studies
- Academic research on compliance costs
- Comparable company experiences

**Important Limitation**: These are **indicative ranges**, not precise calculations

**Professional Reality**: Cost estimation often requires educated assumptions based on limited data

#### **How to Handle Cost Uncertainty**

**In Professional Practice:**

- Use multiple estimation methods
- Provide ranges rather than point estimates
- Clearly state assumptions and limitations
- Update estimates as more data becomes available

**For Your Coursework:**

- Use the provided estimates as reasonable benchmarks
- Acknowledge uncertainty in your analysis
- Consider sensitivity analysis around key cost assumptions
- Focus on methodology rather than precision

**Key Learning Point**: Professional financial analysis often involves working with imperfect information and making reasoned estimates based on available data.

**Coursework Guidance: Working with Cost Estimates**

**What You Should Do:**

- Use the provided cost ranges as starting point
- Select specific values within ranges (e.g., mid-point for base case)
- Explain your selection rationale
- Consider how different cost assumptions affect conclusions

**What You Should NOT Do:**

- Invent completely different cost figures without justification
- Ignore the uncertainty inherent in these estimates
- Present estimates as if they were precise facts

**Professional Approach**: "Based on industry benchmarks, estimated compliance costs range from £X to £Y annually, with £Z used for base case analysis..."

## Financial Impact Analysis

**Connecting to Session 2 NPV Calculation:**

#### **Option 2 Base Case:**

**NPV without compliance**: £395,749 (calculated in Session 2)

**Additional annual costs**: £225,000 (mid-range estimate)

**Present value of costs**: £225,000 × 3.993 (5-year annuity at 8%) = £898,425

#### **Adjusted Financial Analysis:**

**Adjusted NPV**: £395,749 - £898,425 = **-£502,676**

**Critical Insight**: Compliance costs can fundamentally change project viability!

**Strategic Question**: Can benefits offset these costs?

**Sensitivity Analysis for Cost Uncertainty:**

| Cost Scenario | Annual Costs | Present Value | Adjusted NPV | Decision |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Optimistic | £150,000 | £599,450 | -£203,701 | Marginal |
| Base Case | £225,000 | £898,425 | -£502,676 | Reject |
| Pessimistic | £300,000 | £1,197,900 | -£802,151 | Reject |

**Professional Insight**: Even optimistic cost estimates make project financially challenging, highlighting importance of identifying offsetting benefits.

**Coursework Application - Financial Integration**

In your coursework, demonstrate how Directive compliance affects the NPV calculation from Case 2. This integration of legal and financial analysis shows sophisticated understanding.

**Professional Presentation**: Show cost sensitivity analysis and acknowledge estimation uncertainty while maintaining clear analytical framework.

## Step-by-Step Financial Impact Calculation

#### **Step 1: Determine Annual Compliance Costs**

**Option 2 Annual Costs (Mid-range estimate):**

- Supply chain monitoring: £75,000
- Environmental compliance: £60,000
- Reporting and disclosure: £37,500
- Continuous improvement: £52,500
- **Total Annual Cost**: £225,000

**Key Point**: These are additional costs not included in original NPV calculation

## **Step 2: Calculate Present Value Factor**

**Annuity Present Value Factor formula:**

PV Factor = [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r

**Where:**

- r = 8% (discount rate from Session 2)
- n = 5 years (project life)

**Calculation:**

PV Factor = [1 - (1.08)^-5] / 0.08
PV Factor = [1 - 0.6806] / 0.08
PV Factor = 0.3194 / 0.08 = **3.993**

**Important Mathematical Clarification: Negative vs Fractional Exponents**

**What we use in Present Value**: (1 + r)^**-n** (negative exponent)

**What this means**: (1.08)^-5 = 1/(1.08)^5 = 1/1.4693 = 0.6806

**NOT the same as**: (1 + r)^**(1/n)** (fractional exponent) 

**What this would mean**: (1.08)^(1/5) = 5th root of 1.08 = 1.0154

**Critical Difference**:

- **(1.08)^-5 = 0.6806** ← This discounts future values to present value ✓
- **(1.08)^(1/5) = 1.0154** ← This would be completely wrong for PV calculations ✗

**Memory Aid**: 

- **Negative exponent (-n)**: "Negative" time = going **backward** from future to present
- **Fractional exponent (1/n)**: Used for finding **equivalent rates** over different periods (different concept entirely)

## Connecting to Investment Appraisal Fundamentals

#### **Building on Day 1 Discount Factor Concepts**

**Remember from Day 1**: Individual year discount factors at 10%

- Year 1: 1 ÷ (1.10)¹ = 0.909
- Year 2: 1 ÷ (1.10)² = 0.826  
- Year 3: 1 ÷ (1.10)³ = 0.751

**Same Mathematical Principle**: 1 ÷ (1 + r)^n

**Today's Application**: Individual factors at 8% for 5 years

#### **Session 3: Building the Complete Picture**

**Individual Discount Factors at 8%**:

- Year 1: 1 ÷ (1.08)¹ = 0.926
- Year 2: 1 ÷ (1.08)² = 0.857
- Year 3: 1 ÷ (1.08)³ = 0.794
- Year 4: 1 ÷ (1.08)⁴ = 0.735
- Year 5: 1 ÷ (1.08)⁵ = 0.681

**Sum of factors**: 0.926 + 0.857 + 0.794 + 0.735 + 0.681 = **3.993**

**Key Learning Connection**: The annuity present value factor (3.993) is simply the **sum of individual discount factors** for Years 1-5!

#### **Method 1: Year-by-Year (Day 1 Approach)**

| Year | Compliance Cost | Discount Factor | Present Value |
|------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | £225,000 | 0.926 | £208,350 |
| 2 | £225,000 | 0.857 | £192,825 |
| 3 | £225,000 | 0.794 | £178,650 |
| 4 | £225,000 | 0.735 | £165,375 |
| 5 | £225,000 | 0.681 | £153,225 |
| **Total** | | **3.993** | **£898,425** |

#### **Method 2: Annuity Shortcut (Session 3)**

**Annuity PV Factor Formula**: [1 - (1.08)^-5] / 0.08 = 3.993

**Annuity Calculation**: £225,000 × 3.993 = £898,425

**Same Result**: Both methods give identical answers!

**Professional Efficiency**: Annuity formula saves time when cash flows are equal

**Conceptual Bridge**: We've moved from calculating individual cash flows (Day 1) to efficiently handling equal annual cash flows (Session 3) - but the underlying discount factor mathematics remains identical.

#### **Step 3: Calculate Present Value of Costs**

**Present Value of Annual Costs:**

PV = Annual Cost × PV Factor
PV = £225,000 × 3.993
PV = **£898,425**

**Interpretation**: £225,000 per year for 5 years, discounted at 8%, equals £898,425 in today's money

#### **Step 4: Adjust Original NPV**

**Original NPV (from Session 2)**: £395,749
**Less: PV of compliance costs**: £898,425
**Adjusted NPV**: £395,749 - £898,425 = **-£502,676**

**Decision Impact**: Project changes from acceptable (positive NPV) to unacceptable (negative NPV)

**Critical Learning**: Regulatory compliance costs must be integrated into financial analysis - they can fundamentally change investment decisions.

**Excel Formula Reference for Students**

**Present Value Factor**: `=(1-(1+0.08)^-5)/0.08`
**Present Value of Costs**: `=225000*3.993`
**Adjusted NPV**: `=395749-898425`

**Alternative approach**: Use Excel's PV function: `=PV(8%,5,-225000,0,0)`

## Alternative Calculation Methods

#### **Method 1: Year-by-Year Discounting**

| Year | Cost | PV Factor | Present Value |
|------|------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | £225,000 | 0.926 | £208,350 |
| 2 | £225,000 | 0.857 | £192,825 |
| 3 | £225,000 | 0.794 | £178,650 |
| 4 | £225,000 | 0.735 | £165,375 |
| 5 | £225,000 | 0.681 | £153,225 |
| **Total** | | | **£898,425** |

**Result**: Same as annuity method - validates calculation

#### **Method 2: Excel NPV Function**

**Formula**: `=NPV(8%, 225000, 225000, 225000, 225000, 225000)`

**Result**: £898,425

**Coursework Recommendation**: Use annuity method for clarity, but verify with alternative approach
