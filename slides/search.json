This objective:\n\nIs not the same as profit maximization\nRequires considering the needs of other stakeholders\nOften demands high ethical standards\n\n\n\nShareholders have specific characteristics that justify prioritizing their interests:\n\nThey are the effective owners\nThey have a residual claim and bear risk\nThey drive entrepreneurial activity through seeking returns\n\n\n\nHowever, pursuing shareholder wealth maximization can be problematic:\n\nMay undermine the status of other stakeholders\nCan encourage excessive cost-cutting\nMight promote unethical behavior"

Board leadership and company purpose 2. Division of responsibilities 3. Composition, succession and evaluation 4. Audit, risk and internal control 5. Remuneration"
