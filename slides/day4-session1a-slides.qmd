## Assessment Preparation {.unnumbered}

#### **Today's Journey:**

- **Session 1 (9:30-10:30)**: Strategic Analysis for Coursework Case 1
- **Session 2 (11:00-12:30)**: Advanced NPV with Inflation (Case 2)
- **Session 3 (13:30-15:00)**: EU Sustainability Directive Deep Dive
- **Session 4 (Thursday 4pm-6pm on Teams)**: Exam Strategy and Final Prep

#### **Our Goal:** 

Transform theoretical knowledge into practical assessment success

## Session 1 Objectives {.unnumbered}

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Apply systematic strategic analysis frameworks to business decisions
- Distinguish between strategic and operational considerations
- Evaluate stakeholder impacts in corporate decisions
- Develop professional recommendations with clear justification
- **Connect today's work to our investment appraisal framework**

## Reality Check: 

The Educator-Assessor Balance ⚖️

#### **Let's Be Honest About This Dynamic**

I occupy two roles simultaneously: 

**your educator** and **your assessor**. 

This creates an inherent tension that you need to understand.

## **What I Can Give You:**
- ✅ **Generic frameworks** and systematic approaches
- ✅ **Conceptual guidance** on how to think about problems
- ✅ **Quality standards** and expectations
- ✅ **Key success strategies** and best practices
- ✅ **Professional development** insights

## **What I Cannot Give You:**
- ❌ **Specific answers** to your coursework questions
- ❌ **Detailed roadmaps** for your exact case analysis
- ❌ **Model solutions** that you would might be tempted to replicate
- ❌ **Assessment-specific hints** that would compromise fairness

## **Why This Tension Exists:**
- **Educational Integrity**: You need to develop independent analytical skills
- **Assessment Fairness**: All students must have equal opportunity
- **Professional Preparation**: Real-world decisions don't come with answer keys

:::{.callout-note}
**Student Learning Anxiety vs. Professional Reality**

Your anxiety about "getting it right" is understandable but misses the point. In professional practice, there's rarely one "right" answer - there are well-reasoned arguments supported by evidence. That's exactly what we're developing here.
:::

## **How to Navigate This:**
- Focus on **learning the frameworks** rather than seeking specific answers
- Develop **your authentic analytical voice** rather than trying to guess mine
- Use **evidence and reasoning** to support your arguments


## Connecting to Our Learning Journey

| Previous Learning Topic | Core Concepts | Today's Application |
|-----|------------------|---------------------|
| **Investment Appraisal** | NPV, IRR, and payback methods | Apply these tools to real strategic decisions |
| **Cost of Capital** | WACC and cost components calculation | Use cost of capital in strategic evaluation |
| **Dividend Policy** | Distribution strategies exploration | Consider how strategic choices affect shareholder returns |

**Integration**: Strategic decisions must be financially sound AND strategically coherent

## Case 1: Ribs Co Strategic Challenge

::: {.problem-statement}
**The Situation:**

- UK garden tools manufacturer
- High quality, domestic market only
- Recent challenges: cheap foreign imports
- Share price decline, shareholder displeasure
- Two strategic options under consideration
:::

#### **The Decision Framework:**
Both projects have **positive NPV** at current cost of capital - but which creates more value?

:::{.callout-note}
Remember from **Investment Appraisal**: NPV > 0 means accept, but when choosing between projects, select the one with higher NPV and better strategic fit.
:::

## Strategic Option 1: 

- Offshore Production

::: {.problem-statement}
**Strategy Type: Cost Leadership**

**Key Features:**

- Close domestic factory
- Move production to low-cost country
- Labour costs reduced by 75%
- Continue selling only in domestic market
:::

:::{.callout-important}
**Coursework Connection - Project 1**

*"This would involve closing the firm's domestic factory and switching production to a foreign country where labour rates are 1/4 of those in that domestic market. Sales will continue to be targeted exclusively as the domestic market."*
:::

#### **Investment Appraisal Connection:**
This is fundamentally a **cost reduction project** - how would we evaluate it using NPV analysis?

## Strategic Option 2: Domestic Expansion

::: {.problem-statement}
**Strategy Type: Differentiation + Market Development**

**Key Features:**

- £4.5 million investment in new machinery
- 50% capacity increase
- Export high-quality tools to foreign markets (positive cashflow potential)
- Leverage quality reputation internationally
:::

:::{.callout-important}
**Coursework Connection - Project 2**

*"This would involve a new investment in machinery at the domestic factory to allow production to be increased by 50%. The extra tools would be exported and sold as high quality tools in foreign market places."*
:::

#### **Investment Appraisal Connection:**
This is a **growth investment project** - requires detailed NPV analysis with market development risks

## Applying Investment Appraisal Concepts

**From investment appraisal theory, we learned that good investment decisions require:**

1. **Relevant Cash Flows**: Only incremental, future, after-tax flows
2. **Appropriate Discount Rate**: Reflects project risk (using WACC principles)
3. **Multiple Appraisal Methods**: NPV, IRR, payback for complete picture
4. **Risk Assessment**: Sensitivity analysis and scenario planning
5. **Non-Financial Factors**: Strategic fit, implementation challenges

**Today's Application**: Use these principles for strategic choice between options

## Strategic Analysis: Internal Assessment

<!-- Slide rendering check -->

- Established domestic market presence
- Manufacturing expertise and processes
- Brand recognition in quality segment

#### **Critical Question:**
Which option better leverages strengths and addresses weaknesses?
:::

::: {.g-col-6}
#### **Weaknesses:**
- Limited geographic diversification
- Higher cost structure than competitors
- No export experience or capabilities
- Potential over-reliance on domestic market
