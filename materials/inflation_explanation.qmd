# Understanding Inflation Adjustments in NPV Analysis
## A Step-by-Step Intuitive Guide

---

## **The Common Student Error**

### **What Students Often Do Wrong:**

Many students apply inflation like this:

- Year 1: £400,000 wages
- Year 2: £400,000 × (1 + 5%) = £420,000
- Year 3: £400,000 × (1 + 5%) = £420,000 ❌
- Year 4: £400,000 × (1 + 5%) = £420,000 ❌

**This is WRONG!** They're applying 5% to the original amount each year, not compounding.

### **The Real-World Reality:**

Inflation compounds year after year, just like interest in a bank account:

- Year 1: £400,000 wages
- Year 2: £420,000 (last year's wages + 5%)
- Year 3: £441,000 (last year's wages + 5%)
- Year 4: £463,050 (last year's wages + 5%)

**Think of it this way**: If your salary is £40,000 and inflation is 5% annually, your employer doesn't give you £42,000 forever. They give you £42,000 in year 2, then £44,100 in year 3, and so on.

## **The Intuitive Approach: Think Like Money**

### **Imagine You're a £1 Coin in 2024**

**Today**: You can buy a chocolate bar worth £1.00

**After 1 year with 5% inflation**: That same chocolate bar now costs £1.05

- You've lost 5% of your buying power
- The chocolate bar manufacturer's costs went up by 5%

**After 2 years**: The chocolate bar costs £1.05 × 1.05 = £1.1025

- Not £1.10 (which would be simple inflation)
- But £1.1025 (compound inflation)
- Why? Because the manufacturer's costs in year 2 are based on their already-inflated year 1 costs

### **The Mathematical Reality**
Inflation compounds because:

1. **Year 1**: Costs rise by 5% from base year
2. **Year 2**: Costs rise by 5% from the new Year 1 level (not original base)
3. **Year 3**: Costs rise by 5% from the new Year 2 level
4. And so on...

This is exactly like compound interest in reverse - it's compound cost growth!

## **Step-by-Step Calculation Walkthrough**

### **Given Information:**

- Year 1 wages (real terms): £400,000
- Wage inflation: 5% per year
- Project life: 5 years

### **Method 1: Year-by-Year Building (The Learning Approach)**

**Step 1: Start with Year 1 base**

- Year 1 real wages = £400,000
- This is our starting point (no inflation applied yet to Year 1)

**Step 2: Calculate Year 2**

- Year 2 wages = Year 1 wages × (1 + inflation rate)
- Year 2 wages = £400,000 × (1 + 0.05)
- Year 2 wages = £400,000 × 1.05 = £420,000

**Step 3: Calculate Year 3**

- Year 3 wages = Year 2 wages × (1 + inflation rate)
- Year 3 wages = £420,000 × 1.05 = £441,000

**Step 4: Calculate Year 4**

- Year 4 wages = Year 3 wages × 1.05 = £463,050

**Step 5: Calculate Year 5**

- Year 5 wages = Year 4 wages × 1.05 = £486,203

### **Method 2: Direct Formula (The Efficient Approach)**

**The General Formula:**
```
Future Value = Present Value × (1 + inflation rate)^number of years from base
```

**Application:**

- Year 1: £400,000 × (1.05)^0 = £400,000 × 1 = £400,000
- Year 2: £400,000 × (1.05)^1 = £400,000 × 1.05 = £420,000
- Year 3: £400,000 × (1.05)^2 = £400,000 × 1.1025 = £441,000
- Year 4: £400,000 × (1.05)^3 = £400,000 × 1.157625 = £463,050
- Year 5: £400,000 × (1.05)^4 = £400,000 × 1.21550625 = £486,203

**Key Insight**: The exponent represents how many years of compound inflation have occurred since the base year.

## **Visual Comparison: Right vs Wrong**

### **Table Comparison:**

| Year | WRONG Method | RIGHT Method | Difference |
|------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | £400,000 | £400,000 | £0 |
| 2 | £420,000 | £420,000 | £0 |
| 3 | £420,000 | £441,000 | £21,000 |
| 4 | £420,000 | £463,050 | £43,050 |
| 5 | £420,000 | £486,203 | £66,203 |
| **Total** | **£2,080,000** | **£2,210,253** | **£130,253** |

**The Impact**: Using the wrong method understates total costs by £130,253 over 5 years!

### **Why This Matters for NPV:**

- **Underestimating costs** → **Overestimating NPV** → **Wrong investment decision**
- The error gets worse with longer time periods and higher inflation rates
- Professional credibility depends on getting this right

## **Real-World Analogy: Your Mobile Phone Bill**

### **Scenario**: Your mobile provider increases prices by 4% annually

**Year 1**: £50/month
**Year 2**: £50 × 1.04 = £52/month
**Year 3**: £52 × 1.04 = £54.08/month (NOT £52 again!)
**Year 4**: £54.08 × 1.04 = £56.24/month

**Why?** Because the provider's costs (electricity, staff wages, equipment) all went up by 4% in Year 2, so they apply the next 4% increase to the new higher base, not the original £50.

## **The Ribs Co Application**

### **Three Different Inflation Rates - Three Different Calculations**

#### **1. Revenue Inflation: 0%**

- Year 1: £2,000,000
- Year 2: £2,000,000 × (1.00)^1 = £2,000,000
- Year 3: £2,000,000 × (1.00)^2 = £2,000,000
- **Result**: Revenue stays constant (fixed contracts)

#### **2. Wage Inflation: 5%**

- Year 1: £400,000
- Year 2: £400,000 × (1.05)^1 = £420,000
- Year 3: £400,000 × (1.05)^2 = £441,000
- **Result**: Wages compound upward

#### **3. Maintenance Inflation: 6%**

- Year 1: £300,000
- Year 2: £300,000 × (1.06)^1 = £318,000
- Year 3: £300,000 × (1.06)^2 = £337,080
- **Result**: Maintenance costs compound even faster

### **The Business Reality**

This reflects real-world business pressures:
- **Fixed revenue contracts** (no inflation protection)
- **Rising labour costs** (annual pay increases)
- **Increasing maintenance costs** (parts and service inflation)
- **Result**: Profit margins get squeezed over time

## **Excel Formula Implementation**

### **The Student-Friendly Approach**

**In Excel, use this formula structure:**

```excel
// For wages in Year 3 (assuming Year 1 base wage is in cell B10)
=B10*(1+$B$15)^(C$4-1)

Where:

- B10 = Base year wage (£400,000)
- $B$15 = Wage inflation rate (5%)
- C$4 = Current year number (3)
- The "^(C$4-1)" part calculates years of compounding
```

**Breaking it down:**

- Year 1: `=B10*(1+$B$15)^(1-1)` = `=B10*(1.05)^0` = `=B10*1` = £400,000
- Year 2: `=B10*(1+$B$15)^(2-1)` = `=B10*(1.05)^1` = `=B10*1.05` = £420,000
- Year 3: `=B10*(1+$B$15)^(3-1)` = `=B10*(1.05)^2` = `=B10*1.1025` = £441,000

### **Alternative Excel Approaches**

**Method 1: Year-by-Year References**
```excel
Year 1: =B10
Year 2: =C10*(1+$B$15)
Year 3: =D10*(1+$B$15)
```

**Method 2: Direct Compound Formula**
```excel
=Base_Amount*(1+Inflation_Rate)^(Year_Number-1)
```

**Method 3: Using POWER Function**
```excel
=B10*POWER(1+$B$15,C$4-1)
```

## **Common Student Questions & Answers**

### **Q1: "Why doesn't Year 1 have inflation applied?"**
**A**: Year 1 is our base year - it's already stated in "real terms" as of today. Inflation starts affecting costs from Year 2 onwards.

### **Q2: "What if I'm told Year 1 is already inflated?"**
**A**: Read the question carefully. If it says "Year 1 real terms" then no inflation yet. If it says "Year 1 nominal terms" then inflation may already be included.

### **Q3: "Why do different costs have different inflation rates?"**
**A**: Real-world economics! Labour costs (wages) often rise faster than general inflation. Specialized maintenance might rise even faster due to supply chain issues or technical complexity.

### **Q4: "Can I just use the average inflation rate for everything?"**
**A**: No! The question gives you specific rates for a reason. Different cost categories genuinely inflate at different rates in real business.

### **Q5: "What if inflation is negative (deflation)?"**
**A**: The same compound formula works. If inflation is -2%, use (1 + (-0.02)) = 0.98 in your formula.

## **The Bottom Line: Why This Matters**

### **Academic Perspective:**
- **Marks Lost**: Incorrect inflation treatment typically costs 30-50% of available marks
- **Professional Standards**: Real-world financial analysts must get this right
- **Foundation Knowledge**: Understanding compound effects is crucial for all finance topics

### **Business Perspective:**
- **Investment Decisions**: Wrong inflation assumptions lead to wrong project approvals
- **Budgeting**: Companies need accurate cost projections for planning
- **Competitive Advantage**: Better cost forecasting gives strategic advantages

### **Career Perspective:**
- **Interview Questions**: "How do you handle inflation in NPV analysis?" is common
- **Professional Credibility**: Getting basics wrong undermines all other analysis
- **Tool Mastery**: Excel proficiency with compound calculations is essential

## **Practice Tip: The "Sanity Check"**

**Always ask yourself:**
1. **Are my costs going up each year?** (They should with positive inflation)
2. **Are the increases getting bigger each year?** (They should with compounding)
3. **Does my Year 5 wage look reasonable?** (£486k from £400k base with 5% inflation)
4. **Do my totals make sense?** (Higher inflation rates = higher total costs)

**If any answer is "no," check your formula!**

---

## **Memory Aid: The "1.05 Rule"**

**Remember**: 

- 5% inflation doesn't mean "add £20,000 every year"
- 5% inflation means "multiply by 1.05 every year"
- **1.05 × 1.05 × 1.05 ≠ 1.05 + 1.05 + 1.05**
- **Compound growth ≠ Simple addition**

**The mantra**: "Multiply, don't add. Compound, don't accumulate."

This fundamental understanding will serve you well throughout your finance studies and professional career!
