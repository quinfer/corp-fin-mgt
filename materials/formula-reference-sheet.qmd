# Investment Appraisal Methods

## Net Present Value (NPV)

**Formula:**
$$\text{NPV} = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_t}{(1+r)^t}$$

**Where:**

- CF~t~ = Cash flow in period t
- r = Discount rate (cost of capital)
- t = Time period
- n = Project life

**Decision Rule:** Accept if NPV > 0

**Key Points:**

- Use incremental cash flows only
- Include working capital investment and recovery
- Consider opportunity costs (e.g., foregone rental income)

---

## Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

**Definition:** The discount rate that makes NPV = 0

**Formula:** Find r where:
$$\sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_t}{(1+r)^t} = 0$$

**Interpolation Formula:**
$$\text{IRR} = r_1 + \frac{\text{NPV}_1}{\text{NPV}_1 - \text{NPV}_2} \times (r_2 - r_1)$$

**Where:**

- r~1~ = Lower discount rate (giving positive NPV)
- r~2~ = Higher discount rate (giving negative NPV)
- NPV~1~ = NPV at r~1~
- NPV~2~ = NPV at r~2~

**Decision Rule:** Accept if IRR > Cost of Capital

---

## Payback Period

**Simple Payback:**
$$\text{Payback Period} = \text{Time until } \sum_{t=1}^{n} \text{Cash Flow}_t = \text{Initial Investment}$$

**Discounted Payback:**
$$\text{Discounted Payback} = \text{Time until } \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_t}{(1+r)^t} = \text{Initial Investment}$$

**Decision Rule:** Accept if payback period < maximum acceptable period

---

## Accounting Rate of Return (ARR)

**Formula:**
$$\text{ARR} = \frac{\text{Average Annual Profit}}{\text{Average Investment}} \times 100\%$$

**Where:**

- Average Annual Profit = Total profit over project life ÷ Number of years
- Average Investment = (Initial Investment + Residual Value) ÷ 2

**Decision Rule:** Accept if ARR > minimum required return

---

# Cost of Capital Calculations

## Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

**Formula:**
$$r_e = r_f + \beta(r_m - r_f)$$

**Where:**

- r~e~ = Required return on equity (cost of equity)
- r~f~ = Risk-free rate of return
- β = Beta (systematic risk measure)
- r~m~ = Expected market return
- (r~m~ - r~f~) = Market risk premium

**Key Points:**

- Beta = 1: Same risk as market
- Beta > 1: Higher risk than market
- Beta < 1: Lower risk than market

---

## Dividend Valuation Model

**No Growth Model:**
$$K_e = \frac{D}{P_0}$$

**Constant Growth Model:**
$$K_e = \frac{D_1}{P_0} + g = \frac{D_0(1+g)}{P_0} + g$$

**Where:**

- K~e~ = Cost of equity
- D = Annual dividend
- D~0~ = Current dividend
- D~1~ = Next year's expected dividend
- P~0~ = Current share price (ex-dividend)
- g = Growth rate

**Growth Rate Calculation:**
$$g = \sqrt[n]{\frac{D_{current}}{D_{n \text{ years ago}}}} - 1$$

---

## Cost of Debt

**Bank Loans (Untraded Debt):**
$$K_d = i(1-T)$$

**Where:**

- K~d~ = After-tax cost of debt
- i = Interest rate
- T = Tax rate

**Redeemable Bonds (Traded Debt):**

Find the IRR where:
$$\text{Current Market Price} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{\text{Interest}(1-T)}{(1+K_d)^t} + \frac{\text{Redemption Value}}{(1+K_d)^n}$$

---

## Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)

**Formula:**
$$\text{WACC} = \frac{E}{V} \times K_e + \frac{D}{V} \times K_d \times (1-T)$$

**Where:**

- E = Market value of equity
- D = Market value of debt
- V = E + D (total market value)
- K~e~ = Cost of equity
- K~d~ = Before-tax cost of debt
- T = Tax rate

**Key Points:**

- Use market values, not book values
- Tax shield applies to debt only
- Include all sources of finance (ordinary shares, preference shares, all debt)

# Financial Ratios and Metrics

## Leverage Ratios

**Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**
$$\text{Debt-to-Equity} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Equity}}$$

**Debt Ratio:**
$$\text{Debt Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Assets}}$$

**Equity Ratio:**
$$\text{Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Equity}}{\text{Total Assets}}$$

**Times Interest Earned (Interest Cover):**
$$\text{Times Interest Earned} = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest Expense}}$$

---

## Dividend Policy Ratios

**Dividend Payout Ratio:**
$$\text{Dividend Payout Ratio} = \frac{\text{Dividends Paid}}{\text{Net Income}} \times 100\%$$

**Dividend Yield:**
$$\text{Dividend Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividend per Share}}{\text{Market Price per Share}} \times 100\%$$

**Retention Ratio:**
$$\text{Retention Ratio} = \frac{\text{Retained Earnings}}{\text{Net Income}} = 1 - \text{Dividend Payout Ratio}$$

---

# Inflation Adjustments

## Real vs Nominal Rates

**Fisher Equation:**
$$\text{Nominal Rate} = (1 + \text{Real Rate}) \times (1 + \text{Inflation Rate}) - 1$$

**Approximation (for low rates):**
$$\text{Nominal Rate} \approx \text{Real Rate} + \text{Inflation Rate}$$

## Cash Flow Adjustments

**Inflating Cash Flows:**
$$\text{Nominal Cash Flow}_t = \text{Real Cash Flow}_t \times (1 + \text{inflation rate})^t$$

**Deflating Cash Flows:**
$$\text{Real Cash Flow}_t = \frac{\text{Nominal Cash Flow}_t}{(1 + \text{inflation rate})^t}$$

**Key Principle:** Use real cash flows with real discount rates OR nominal cash flows with nominal discount rates - never mix!

---

# Present Value Tables Usage

## Present Value Factor

**Single Cash Flow:**
$$\text{PV} = \text{Future Value} \times \frac{1}{(1+r)^t}$$

**From tables:** Look up discount factor for given rate and period

## Annuity Present Value

**For equal annual cash flows:**
$$\text{PV of Annuity} = \text{Annual Cash Flow} \times \text{Annuity Factor}$$

**Annuity Factor:**
$$\text{Annuity Factor} = \frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r}$$

# Common Calculations Checklist

## NPV Calculation Steps

1. ✓ Identify all relevant cash flows (incremental, future, after-tax)
2. ✓ Include initial investment and working capital
3. ✓ Consider opportunity costs and terminal values
4. ✓ Apply appropriate discount rate consistently
5. ✓ Sum all present values to get NPV
6. ✓ State decision clearly (Accept if NPV > 0)

## WACC Calculation Steps

1. ✓ Calculate market values for all capital sources
2. ✓ Determine cost of each component:
   - Equity: Use CAPM or dividend model
   - Preference shares: Dividend ÷ Market price
   - Debt: Yield to maturity × (1 - Tax rate)
3. ✓ Calculate weights based on market values
4. ✓ Apply tax shield to debt costs only
5. ✓ Multiply costs by weights and sum

## Bond Valuation Steps

1. ✓ Identify annual coupon payments
2. ✓ Determine maturity date and redemption value
3. ✓ Apply appropriate discount rate
4. ✓ Calculate present value of coupon stream (annuity)
5. ✓ Calculate present value of redemption payment
6. ✓ Sum to get bond value

| **IRR** | NPV = 0 | Accept if IRR > cost of capital |

| **WACC** | (E/V)×r~e~ + (D/V)×r~d~×(1-T) | Use market values |
| **Dividend Model** | D₁/P₀ + g | Use ex-dividend price |
| **Gearing** | Debt/(Debt + Equity) | Higher = more financial risk |
