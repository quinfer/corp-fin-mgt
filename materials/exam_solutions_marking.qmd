::: {.marking}
**Marking Allocation:**
- Correct discount factors from tables: 1 mark
- Accurate present value calculations: 2 marks
- Correct NPV calculation: 1 mark
:::

**Decision:** Accept the project as NPV > 0, indicating it will add value to shareholders.

---

### Part (b): IRR Calculation [5 marks]

**Method: Trial and Error with Interpolation**

At 20% discount rate:
NPV = -£990,000 + £200,000(0.833) + £314,400(0.694) + £438,576(0.579) + £482,519(0.482) + £566,220(0.402)
NPV = -£990,000 + £166,600 + £218,194 + £253,935 + £232,574 + £227,632 = £108,935

At 25% discount rate:
NPV = -£990,000 + £200,000(0.800) + £314,400(0.640) + £438,576(0.512) + £482,519(0.410) + £566,220(0.328)
NPV = -£990,000 + £160,000 + £201,216 + £224,551 + £197,833 + £185,724 = -£20,676

**Interpolation:**
IRR = 20% + [£108,935/(£108,935 - (-£20,676))] × (25% - 20%)
IRR = 20% + [£108,935/£129,611] × 5% = 20% + 4.2% = **24.2%**

::: {.marking}
**Marking Allocation:**
- Attempting two discount rates with one giving positive, one negative NPV: 2 marks
- Correct interpolation formula application: 2 marks
- Correct IRR calculation: 1 mark
- Accept IRR between 24% and 25% with reasonable working
:::

**Decision:** Accept the project as IRR (24.2%) > Cost of Capital (9%).

### Part (c): Discounted Payback Period [5 marks]

**Cumulative Discounted Cash Flows:**

| Year | Discounted Cash Flow | Cumulative DCF |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| 0 | (£990,000) | (£990,000) |
| 1 | £183,400 | (£806,600) |
| 2 | £264,725 | (£541,875) |
| 3 | £338,580 | (£203,295) |
| 4 | £341,624 | £138,329 |

Recovery occurs in Year 4.

Fraction of Year 4 needed = £203,295 ÷ £341,624 = 0.60

**Discounted Payback Period = 3.60 years**

::: {.marking}
**Marking Allocation:**
- Correct cumulative discounted cash flow calculations: 3 marks

### Part (d): Board Memo [8 marks]

**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** Board of Directors, Oakland Plc  
**FROM:** Financial Analysis Team  
**DATE:** [Current Date]  
**RE:** Investment Project Appraisal Results

**Executive Summary**
Our analysis of the proposed £990,000 investment project yields mixed signals across different appraisal methods, requiring careful consideration of our investment criteria and strategic objectives.

**Financial Analysis Results**

*Net Present Value: £506,372 (ACCEPT)*
The project generates significant positive value, indicating returns exceed our 9% cost of capital requirement.

*Internal Rate of Return: 24.2% (ACCEPT)*  
The project's return substantially exceeds our hurdle rate, demonstrating strong profitability.

*Discounted Payback Period: 3.60 years (REJECT)*
The project exceeds our 3-year payback policy, indicating higher liquidity risk than preferred.

**Recommendation**
Despite failing our payback criteria, the strong NPV and IRR results suggest accepting this project would create substantial shareholder value. We recommend reviewing our rigid payback policy in light of these compelling financial returns.

**Non-Financial Considerations**
- **Strategic fit** with company's long-term objectives
- **Market timing** and competitive positioning
- **Resource availability** and implementation capacity  
- **Technology risk** and obsolescence potential

Beta measures the systematic risk of an individual security relative to the market portfolio. A beta of 0.9 indicates Triglass shares are 10% less volatile than the overall market, moving 0.9% for every 1% market movement.

**CAPM Assumptions:**
1. **Efficient markets** - all investors have access to same information
2. **Rational investors** - all seek to maximize utility for given risk level
3. **Perfect capital markets** - no transaction costs or taxes
4. **Homogeneous expectations** - all investors have identical forecasts
5. **Single period focus** - all investors have same investment horizon
6. **Risk-free borrowing/lending** - unlimited access at risk-free rate

::: {.marking}
**Marking Allocation:**
- Clear explanation of beta concept with correct interpretation: 2 marks

### Part (c): WACC Calculation [15 marks]

**Step 1: Calculate Market Values**

*Ordinary Shares:*
Market Value = 3.5 million × £12 = £42 million

*Preference Shares:*
Market Value = 2 million × £6.7 = £13.4 million

*Debentures:*
Market Value = £15 million × (£97/£100) = £14.55 million

**Total Market Value = £69.95 million**

::: {.marking}
**Marking Note:** Award 3 marks for correct market value calculations. Common error: using book value for debentures instead of market value.
:::

**Step 2: Calculate Component Costs**

*Cost of Ordinary Shares (CAPM):*
Ke = 4.5% + 0.9(12% - 4.5%) = 4.5% + 6.75% = **11.25%**

*Cost of Preference Shares:*
Kp = (£1 × 65%)/£6.7 = £0.65/£6.7 = **9.70%**

*Cost of Debentures:*
Current yield approximation = £8/£97 = 8.25%
After-tax cost = 8.25% × (1 - 0.30) = **5.78%**

::: {.marking}
**Marking Allocation:**
- Correct CAPM calculation: 3 marks
- Correct preference share cost: 2 marks  
- Reasonable debenture cost calculation: 3 marks
- Accept current yield approximation or more precise IRR calculation
:::

**Step 3: Calculate WACC**

| Component | Market Value | Weight | Cost | Weighted Cost |
|-----------|--------------|--------|------|---------------|
| Ordinary Shares | £42.0m | 60.04% | 11.25% | 6.75% |
| Preference Shares | £13.4m | 19.16% | 9.70% | 1.86% |
| Debentures | £14.55m | 20.80% | 5.78% | 1.20% |

**WACC = 6.75% + 1.86% + 1.20% = 9.81%**

::: {.marking}
**Marking Allocation:**
- Correct weight calculations: 2 marks
- Accurate WACC computation: 2 marks
- Professional presentation of workings: 1 mark
:::

### Part (d): Gearing Analysis [5 marks]

**Current Gearing Ratio:**
Debt = £14.55m (debentures market value)
Equity = £42m + £13.4m = £55.4m
Current Gearing = £14.55m / (£14.55m + £55.4m) = **20.8%**

**Gearing with New Loan:**
New Debt = £14.55m + £10m = £24.55m
Gearing with loan = £24.55m / (£24.55m + £55.4m) = **30.7%**

**Impact Analysis:**
- **Financial Risk Increase:** Higher gearing increases financial leverage and earnings volatility
- **Interest Cover Reduction:** Fixed interest obligations increase relative to earnings
- **Share Price Impact:** May initially decline due to increased risk, but could improve if returns exceed cost of debt
- **Future Flexibility:** Reduced capacity for additional debt financing

::: {.marking}
**Marking Allocation:**
- Correct current gearing calculation: 1 mark
- Correct gearing with loan: 1 mark
- Thoughtful discussion of financial risk impact: 2 marks

## Question 4: Dividend Policy [20 marks]

### Part (a): Dividend Policy Factors [8 marks]

**1. Legal and Regulatory Constraints**
Companies can only pay dividends from distributable reserves (accumulated profits). Regulatory requirements and loan covenants may impose additional restrictions on dividend payments.

**2. Cash Flow and Liquidity Position**  
Dividend payments require actual cash, not just accounting profits. Companies must ensure sufficient liquidity for operations and obligations before committing to dividend payments.

**3. Investment Opportunities and Capital Requirements**
The residual dividend theory suggests companies should first fund all positive NPV projects before paying dividends. Growth companies typically retain more earnings for reinvestment.

**4. Signalling Effects and Market Expectations**
Dividend changes send powerful signals about management's confidence in future prospects. Markets often interpret dividend cuts as negative signals about company performance.

**Additional Factors (award marks for any of these):**
- **Shareholder Composition:** Income-focused vs growth-focused investors
- **Tax Implications:** Different tax treatment of dividends vs capital gains
- **Competitive Position:** Industry norms and peer company policies
- **Economic Conditions:** Market volatility and uncertainty levels

::: {.marking}
**Marking Allocation:**
- Each well-explained factor: 2 marks (maximum 4 factors)
- Accept alternative valid factors with proper explanation
- Award partial credit for identification without explanation
:::

### Part (b): Anta Plc Options Analysis [12 marks]

**Current Situation Analysis:**
- Surplus earnings: £100,000 (current year)
- Cash reserves: £500,000 (accumulated from failed acquisition)
- Low return on cash: 2% (below likely cost of equity)
- Established dividend policy with gradual increases
- Volatile earnings pattern

**Option 1: Maintain Current Dividend Policy**

*Advantages:*
- Preserves signalling consistency and market confidence
- Maintains shareholder expectations and income streams
- Provides flexibility for future acquisition opportunities

*Disadvantages:*
- Inefficient use of excess cash earning below-market returns
- May signal lack of investment opportunities to market
- Opportunity cost of 2% return vs shareholder alternatives

**Option 2: Special Dividend Payment**

*Advantages:*
- Returns excess cash to shareholders immediately
- Allows higher returns than 2% bank interest
- One-time payment doesn't commit to higher ongoing dividends

*Disadvantages:*
- May signal lack of profitable investment opportunities
- Could create expectations for future special dividends
- Reduces financial flexibility for unexpected opportunities

**Option 3: Share Buyback Programme**

*Advantages:*
- Tax-efficient return of cash (capital gains vs dividend taxation)
- Increases earnings per share for remaining shareholders
- Signals management confidence in share value
- More flexible than committing to higher dividends

*Disadvantages:*
- May signal shares are undervalued (negative market perception)
- Reduces permanent capital base
- Requires regulatory compliance and disclosure

**Option 4: Increase Regular Dividend**

*Advantages:*
- Continues established policy of gradual increases
- Provides higher ongoing income to shareholders
- Positive market signalling about future prospects

*Disadvantages:*
- Creates expectation of sustained higher payments
- May be difficult to maintain if earnings decline
- Uses volatile earnings to support permanent commitment

**Recommendation:**
Given the company's volatile earnings and substantial cash position, a combination approach would be optimal:
1. **Special dividend** of £300,000 to return most excess cash
2. **Modest increase** in regular dividend reflecting sustainable earnings growth
3. **Retain** £200,000 for operational flexibility and future opportunities

This approach returns excess cash efficiently while maintaining dividend policy consistency and preserving financial flexibility.

::: {.marking}
**Marking Allocation:**
- Clear identification of available options: 3 marks
- Analysis of advantages/disadvantages for each option: 6 marks
- Logical recommendation with justification: 2 marks
- Recognition of company's specific circumstances: 1 mark

## Question 5: Meridian Industries Advanced WACC [20 marks]

### Part (a): Current WACC Calculation [12 marks]

**Step 1: Calculate Market Values**

*Ordinary Shares:*
Market Value = 5 million × £8.50 = £42.5 million

*Preference Shares:*  
Market Value = 1 million × £1.85 = £1.85 million

*Corporate Bonds:*
Market Value = £20 million × 1.05 = £21 million

*Bank Loan:*
Market Value = £15 million (book value = market value)

**Total Market Value = £80.35 million**

::: {.marking}
**Marking Allocation:**
- Correct market value calculations: 3 marks
- Proper treatment of bond premium: 1 mark
:::

**Step 2: Calculate Component Costs**

*Cost of Ordinary Shares (CAPM):*
Ke = 3.8% + 1.1(11.2% - 3.8%) = 3.8% + 8.14% = **11.94%**

*Cost of Preference Shares:*
Kp = (£2 × 6%)/£1.85 = £0.12/£1.85 = **6.49%**

*Cost of Corporate Bonds (IRR Method):*
Bond trading at £105, pays £7 annually, redeems at £100 in 4 years.

Testing 5%: 
PV = £7(3.546) + £100(0.823) = £24.82 + £82.30 = £107.12 (too high)

Testing 6%:
PV = £7(3.465) + £100(0.792) = £24.26 + £79.20 = £103.46 (too low)

Interpolation: IRR ≈ 5% + [(£107.12-£105)/(£107.12-£103.46)] × 1% = **5.58%**

After-tax cost = 5.58% × (1-0.25) = **4.19%**

*Cost of Bank Loan:*
Kd = 5.5% × (1-0.25) = **4.13%**

::: {.marking}
**Marking Allocation:**
- Correct CAPM calculation: 2 marks
- Correct preference share cost: 1 mark
- Bond IRR calculation with interpolation: 3 marks
- Correct tax adjustments: 1 mark
:::

**Step 3: Calculate WACC**

| Component | Market Value | Weight | Cost | Weighted Cost |
|-----------|--------------|--------|------|---------------|
| Ordinary Shares | £42.5m | 52.89% | 11.94% | 6.31% |
| Preference Shares | £1.85m | 2.30% | 6.49% | 0.15% |
| Corporate Bonds | £21.0m | 26.13% | 4.19% | 1.09% |
| Bank Loan | £15.0m | 18.68% | 4.13% | 0.77% |

**WACC = 6.31% + 0.15% + 1.09% + 0.77% = 8.32%**

::: {.marking}
**Marking Allocation:**
- Correct weight calculations: 1 mark
- Accurate WACC computation: 1 mark

### Part (b): Critical Evaluation of Using Same WACC [5 marks]

**Problems with Using Current WACC:**

**Risk Profile Mismatch:**
The current WACC reflects domestic operations with β = 1.1, while international expansion involves significantly higher business risk (β = 1.6-2.2). Using domestic WACC would underestimate required returns.

**Country and Political Risks:**
Emerging markets involve additional risks not captured in domestic WACC:
- Currency volatility and exchange rate risk
- Political instability and regulatory changes  
- Different legal frameworks and enforcement
- Economic instability and inflation risks

**Market Risk Premium Differences:**
Emerging markets typically require higher risk premiums than developed markets, suggesting the UK market risk premium understates international requirements.

**Financing Cost Differences:**
International operations may face different financing costs due to:
- Limited access to local capital markets
- Currency hedging requirements
- Different credit ratings in foreign markets

**Recommendation:**
The finance director's approach is inappropriate. A risk-adjusted discount rate reflecting the higher systematic risk and additional country-specific risks should be applied to properly evaluate the international expansion.

::: {.marking}
**Marking Allocation:**
- Recognition of risk profile differences: 2 marks
- Identification of additional international risks: 2 marks
- Clear recommendation with justification: 1 mark
:::

---

### Part (c): Appropriate Cost of Capital Calculation [3 marks]

**Risk-Adjusted Approach:**

Using average beta for similar international operations: β = 1.8

**Adjusted Cost of Equity:**
Ke = 3.8% + 1.8(11.2% - 3.8%) = 3.8% + 13.32% = **17.12%**

**Project Financing Costs:**
- New debt cost (after-tax): 8% × (1-0.25) = 6%
- New equity cost (including issue costs): 17.12% ÷ (1-0.04) = 17.83%

**Project-Specific WACC:**
Assuming proportional financing (60% equity, 40% debt):
Project WACC = (0.6 × 17.83%) + (0.4 × 6%) = 10.70% + 2.40% = **13.10%**

**Alternative Approach:**
Add country risk premium of 3-5% to current WACC:
Adjusted WACC = 8.32% + 4% = **12.32%**

::: {.marking}
**Marking Allocation:**
- Logical approach to risk adjustment: 1 mark
- Reasonable calculation methodology: 1 mark  
- Appropriate final rate (accept 12-14% range): 1 mark
- Accept alternative approaches with proper justification
